Are you good at programming? If you know some programming
languages such as Visual Basic or even Java, C#, or C++, you can
explore high-frequency strategies, and you can also trade a large
number of securities. Otherwise, settle for strategies that trade only
once a day, or trade just a few stocks, futures, or currencies. (This
constraint may be overcome if you don’t mind the expense of hiring
a software contractor. Again, see Chapter 5 for more details.)

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat -
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
   In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com -
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
   The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa -
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

Forex Strategies Based on Trading Style
   Portfolio trading, which can also be called basket trading, is based on the combination of different 
assets belonging to different financial markets (Forex, stock, futures, etc.).
   The concept behind portfolio trading is diversification, one of the most popular means of risk re -
duction. By a smart asset allocation traders protect themselves from market volatility, reduce the risk 
extent and keep the profit balance.
   It’s very important to create a diversified portfolio to reach your trading goal. Otherwise, this kind 
of strategy will be aimless.
   Currently IFC Markets offers a new method, called GeWorko Method, which makes it even much 
easier for you to perform portfolio trading. The method provides numerous opportunities for traders 
to take the highest profit from trade. By Geworko Method you can create portfolios starting from 
only two assets up to hundreds of different financial instruments, open both long and short positions 
within a portfolio, view the assets’ price history stretching up to 40 years, create your own PCIs, use 
a wide variety of market analysis tools, apply different trading strategies and constantly optimize and 
rebalance your portfolio. In other words, GeWorko Method seems the integrity of all trading opportu-
nities and strategies, through which you can organize your trade in the way you desire, develop the

trade on my own, I worried that I would be cut off from the ﬂow
of trading ideas from my colleagues and mentors. But then I found
out that one of the best ways to gather and share trading ideas is
to start your own trading blog—for every trading “secret” that you
divulge to the world, you will be rewarded with multiple ones from
your readers. (The person who suggested the Wealth-Lab strategy to
me was a reader who works 12 time zones away. If it weren’t for my
blog, there was little chance that I would have met him and bene-
ﬁted from his suggestion.) In fact, what you thought of as secrets
are more often than not well-known ideas to many others! What
truly make a strategy proprietary and its secrets worth protecting
are the tricks and variations that you have come up with, not the
plain vanilla version.
Furthermore, your bad ideas will quickly get shot down by your
online commentators, thus potentially saving you from major losses.
After I glowingly described a seasonal stock-trading strategy on
my blog that was developed by some ﬁnance professors, a reader
promptly went ahead and backtested that strategy and reported that
it didn’t work. (See my blog entry, “Seasonal Trades in Stocks,”
at epchan.blogspot.com/2007/11/seasonal-trades-in-stocks.html and

ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing
the money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this
strategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of
important advanced concepts with which most professional quan-
titative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with
reﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how
they can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that
contains a tutorial on using MATLAB.
You’ll see two different types of boxed material in this book:
r Sidebars containing an elaboration or illustration of a concept, and
r Examples, accompanied by MATLAB or Excel code.

Fishing for Ideas
Where Can We Find
Good Strategies?
T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actuallynot the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as

“This book provides valuable insight into how private investors can establish a solid structure for success 
i
n algorithmic trading. Ernie’s extensive hands-on experience in building trading systems is invaluable for 
aspiring traders who wish to take their knowledge to the next level.”
— RAMON CUMMINS, private investor
“Out of the many books and articles on quantitative trading that I’ve read over the years, very few have 
b
een of much use at all. In most instances, the authors have no real knowledge of the subject matter, or do 
have something important to say but are unwilling to do so because of fears of having trade secrets stolen. 
Ernie subscribes to a different credo: Share meaningful information and have meaningful interactions 
with the quantitative community at large. Ernie successfully distills a large amount of detailed and difﬁ cult 
subject matter down to a very clear and comprehensive resource for novice and pro alike.”

alent to apply bagging to Logitboost (bagged boosting) or
to average all the experts. The threshold to eliminate very
weak expert weights (γ0) is set to 0.20, and the threshold
to restrict trading (γ1) is set to 0.
We tested our results with transaction costs of $0,
$0.001, $0.002, and $0.003 per stock. These values are
realistic if we consider that ISLAND has the policy to pay
a rebate of $0.002 per stock to the trader whose order was
in the order books, and charges a rebate of $0.003 per stock
to the trader that submitted the incoming order. Traders can
use this policy in their favour and do not have to pay the full
fee of $0.003. On the contrary, they can capture the rebate
using only limit orders as the market maker strategy sug-
gests. Even more, large brokerage ﬁrms have much lower
direct transaction costs and the initial investment to trade
becomes a sink cost that does not have a major impact in
individual trades.
We compare our results with a buy and hold (B&H)
position, a constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP), and
Cover’s universal portfolio (CUP) algorithm.
CRP and
CUP are implemented with uniform distributions, and with
10 different portfolios for the case of CUP9.

A major problem with the use of technical indica-
tors is their calibration or the adequate selection of their
best parameters, as with the optimal number of days to
calculate the moving averages used by stochastic indica-
tors or the number of standard deviations used to calcu-
late the Bollinger bands. There are many versions of op-
timizers such as the “brute force” approach where all the
alternatives are tested one-at-a-time, and simulated anneal-
ing or genetic optimizers as suggested by Katz and Mc-
Cormick [44]. In our case, we initially tried one-at-a-time
optimization where each parameter was tested with several
values while keeping the others constant. We found that
this approach was very inefﬁcient because it required too
much computer power and time.
The solution that we implemented was the simulta-
neous recalculation of the technical indicators with several
values of their parameters. Then the boosting algorithm
would select the best combination of parameters and tech-
nical indicators. Our initial parameters were the parame-
ters recommended in the literature. We tested 16 different
variations of the initial parameters and did not ﬁnd a major

Abstract
Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classiﬁcation benchmarks
have come from better conﬁgurations of existing techniques rather than novel ap-
proaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been
the job of humans because they can be very efﬁcient in regimes where only a few
trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it pos-
sible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can ﬁnd better
results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neu-
ral networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters
using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the ex-
pected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufﬁciently
efﬁcient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreli-
able for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difﬁcult
DBN learning problems from [1] and ﬁnd signiﬁcantly better results than the best

STRATEGY REFINEMENT
If a strategy does not deliver superb backtest performance on ﬁrst
trial, there are some common ways to improve it. How to reﬁne a
strategy without introducing data-snooping bias and to remain sim-
ple with few parameters is more of an art than a science. The guid-
ing principle is the same as that of parameter optimization: What-
ever changes you make to the strategy to improve its performance
on the training set, it must also improve the performance on the
test set.
Often, there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well
known in traders’ circles and are still somewhat proﬁtable, though
their returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trad-
ing of stocks. The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too
many traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and
gradually erasing the proﬁt margin. However, it is often possible to
introduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will boost its
returns.

captures the relationship between parameters and objective function values. As evaluations accumulate, the
model is refined, guiding the exploration process.
4. Acquisition Function & Stopping Criteria: An acquisition function prioritizes the selection of the next
parameter combination for evaluation, balancing exploration and exploitation. Common functions include
Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). The process continues until a stopping
criterion (e.g., maximum evaluations or desired performance) is met.

values indicate improvement in profit after BO.Negative value suggests a decrease.
• The improvement percentage for Nifty 50 is N/A because the default profit was 0. Dividing by 0 is undefined.
8 Discussion and Conclusion
• Strategy Performance: The overall effectiveness of the BO-optimized Supertrend strategy can be determined by
analyzing the results in the table above. The values for most stocks are positive suggests that BO successfully
identified parameter combinations that improved the strategy’s performance compared to the default settings.
• BO Effectiveness: Based on the BO results (iteration tables, visualizations, convergence plots - shown above),
discusses how BO efficiently explored the search space and converged towards potentially optimal parameter
combinations for each Indian and international stock.
• BO Limitations:
– The effectiveness of BO is highly dependent on the chosen objective function and the quality of historical
data used for training.
– BO might get trapped in local optima if the search space is not well-defined or the objective function is
complex.
• Future Studies:
– Exploring the use of different BO algorithms or objective functions to potentially enhance optimization
results.
– Investigating to incorporate additional parameters into the optimization process for a more comprehensive
strategy fine-tuning.
– Testing the generalized ,ability of BO-optimized parameters across different market conditions using
forward testing.

have been proposed. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this is often equal to in-
troducing an informative prior on the weights, and ﬁnding the optimal set
of weights via Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) [3]. More formally,
given a data set Dand a prior distribution of the weights, p(w), the optimal

3.2.1 The expert weighting algorithm
To simplify the presentation of our algorihtm, we introduce
the case of one asset which can easily be extended to N as-
sets. The ﬁnal outcome sequence are the net weights of an
asset (W = W1,W2,..,W t,...,W l) where Wt ∈[−1,1],
trefers to a time step and l represents the last step of the
sequence.
In this research, every expert is an ADT calculated
with the training set which is a sequence of pairs as intro-

used to calculate the performance and risk indicators. The
average of these results are presented in the next section.
We ran the expert weighting algorithm using its three ver-
sions and the following values of the parameter C: 0, 0.05,

posed by Freund, Manssour and Schapire [34] that predicts

ror of all hypotheses. The “exponential weights” formula

Backtesting is about conducting a realistic historical simulation of
the performance of a strategy. The hope is that the future perfor-
mance of the strategy will resemble its past performance, though as
your investment manager will never tire of telling you, this is by no
means guaranteed!
There are many nuts and bolts involved in creating a realis-
tic historical backtest and in reducing the divergence of the future

CHAPTER 3
Backtesting
A key difference between a traditional investment management pro-
cess and a quantitative investment process is the possibility of back-
testing a quantitative investment strategy to see how it would have
performed in the past. Even if you found a strategy described in
complete detail with all the historical performance data available,
you would still need to backtest it yourself. This exercise serves
several purposes. If nothing else, this replication of the research will
ensure that you have understood the strategy completely and have
reproduced it exactly for implementation as a trading system. Just
as in any medical or scientiﬁc research, replicating others’ results
also ensures that the original research did not commit any of the
common errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-
ing due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-
iment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and
improving the strategy.
In this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can
be used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for
backtesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a
backtest should provide, common pitfalls to avoid, and simple re-
ﬁnements and improvements to strategies. A few fully developed
backtesting examples will also be presented to illustrate the prin-
ciples and techniques described.

Backtesting 35
TradeStation
TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) is familiar to many retail
traders as a brokerage that provides all-in-one backtesting and trade
execution platforms linked to the brokerage’s servers. The main ad-
vantages of this setup are:
r Most of the historical data necessary for backtesting is readily
available, whereas you have to download the data from some-
where else if you use Excel or MATLAB.
r Once you have backtested the program, you can immediately
generate orders using the same program and transmit them to
the brokerage.
The disadvantages of this approach are that once you have writ-
ten the software for your strategy, you are tied to TradeStation as
your broker, and the proprietary language used by TradeStation is
not as ﬂexible as MATLAB and does not include some of the more
advanced statistical and mathematical functions some traders use.
Nevertheless, if you prefer the ease of use of an all-in-one system,
TradeStation may be a good choice.
Since I have not used TradeStation in my own work, I will not
include backtesting examples in TradeStation.

Another beneﬁt of paper trading is that it gives you better in-
tuitive understanding of your strategy, including the volatility of its
P&L, the typical amount of capital utilized, the number of trades per
day, and the various operational difﬁculties including data issues.
Even though you can theoretically check out most of these features
of your strategy in a backtest, one will usually gain intuition only if
one faces them on a daily, ongoing basis. Backtesting also won’t re-
veal the operational difﬁculties, such as how fast you can download
all the needed data before the market opens each day and how you
can optimize your operational procedures in actual execution.
(Do not underestimate the time required for preparing your or-
ders before the market opens. It took me some 20 minutes to down-
load and parse all my historical data each morning, and it took an-
other 15 minutes or so to transmit all the orders to my account. If
your trading strategy depends on data or news prior to the market
open that cannot be more than 35 minutes old, then you need to
either ﬁgure out a different execution environment or modify your

consultant in case you would like someone to help automate the ex-
ecution of your trading strategy.
Building a Semiautomated Trading System
In a semiautomated trading system (shown in Figure 5.1), a user
typically generates a list of orders using familiar and easy-to-use
software such as Excel or MATLAB. Often, the program that gen-
erates this order list is the same as the backtest program: After all,
you are implementing the same quantitative strategy that you have
backtested. Of course, you must remember to update the input data
ﬁle to reﬂect the most recent data. This is usually done with either
a MATLAB program that can directly go to a web site to retrieve
the appropriate data, or with a separate program such as HQuote,
mentioned earlier, which can download en masse historical price
data for a large number of symbols. In the latter case, MATLAB is
used only to organize those data in a suitable format for the trading
strategy program that generates today’s orders.
The data update step is easy when the most recent data is the
previous day’s close, but certainly more difﬁcult when it is the last
intraday price. When the data required is the last price, your data
vendor or brokerage must provide a DDE link that automatically

generated a large amount of commissions in the previous trading
month, Interactive Brokers allows you to update only 100 sym-
bols by default.) Similarly, order submissions through DDE links
are also slow. Hence, for trading strategies that react to real-time
market data changes intraday, this setup using a spreadsheet is not
feasible.
There are some brokerages such as TradeStation that offer a
complete backtesting and order submission platform. If you back-
tested on such a platform, then it is trivial to conﬁgure it so that
the program will submit real orders to your account. This dispenses
with the need to write your own software, whether for backtesting
or for automated execution. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 3,
the drawback of such proprietary systems is that they are seldom as
ﬂexible as a general-purpose programming language like MATLAB
or Java for the construction of your strategy. For instance, if you
want to pursue a rather mathematically complex strategy based on
principal component analysis (such as the one in Example 7.4), it
would be quite difﬁcult to backtest in TradeStation. More advanced
integrated trading platforms such as Alphacet’s Discovery do

closer examination. Sometimes, even the most thorough and careful
backtest cannot reveal problems that would be obvious after a few
months of paper or real trading. One can always revisit each of these
issues after the model has gone live.
Once you have backtested a strategy with reasonable perfor-
mance, you are now ready to take the next step in setting up your
trading business.

of Excel is that it can be used to backtest only fairly simple models.
But, as I explained in the previous chapter, simple models are often
the best!
MATLAB
MATLAB R⃝ (www.mathworks.com) is one of the most common
backtesting platforms used by quantitative analysts and traders in
large institutions. It is ideal for testing strategies that involve a
large portfolio of stocks. (Imagine backtesting a strategy involving
1,500 symbols on Excel—it is possible, but quite painful.). It has nu-
merous advanced statistical and mathematical modules built in, so
traders do not have to reinvent the wheel if their trading algorithms
involve some sophisticated but common mathematical concepts.

TESTING YOUR SYSTEM BY
PAPER TRADING
After you have built your automated trading system, it is a good idea
to test it in a paper trading account, if your brokerage provides one.
Paper trading has a number of beneﬁts; chief among them is that
this is practically the only way to see if your ATS software has bugs
without losing a lot of real money.
Often, the moment you start paper trading you will realize that
there is a glaring look-ahead bias in your strategy—there may just be
no way you could have obtained some crucial piece of data before
you enter an order! If this happens, it is “back to the drawing board.”
You should be able run your ATS, execute paper trades, and then
compare the paper trades and proﬁt and loss (P&L) with the theoret-
ical ones generated by your backtest program using the latest data.
If the difference is not due to transaction costs (including an ex-
pected delay in execution for the paper trades), then your software
likely has bugs. (I mentioned the names of some of the brokerages
that offer paper trading accounts in Chapter 4.)
Another beneﬁt of paper trading is that it gives you better in-
tuitive understanding of your strategy, including the volatility of its
P&L, the typical amount of capital utilized, the number of trades per
day, and the various operational difﬁculties including data issues.

LAB. In fact, I have included a brief tutorial in the appendix on how
to do some basic programming in MATLAB. For many retail traders,
MATLAB is too expensive to purchase, but there are cheaper alter-
natives, which I will mention in Chapter 3 on backtesting. Further-
more, many university students can either purchase a cheaper stu-
dent MATLAB license or they already have free access to it through
their schools.

stead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy
yourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how
to reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical
performance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain

common errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-
ing due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-

proﬁcient at it, will enable you to backtest trading strategies much
more efﬁciently, and may also allow you to retrieve and process
data much more easily than you otherwise can. This tool is called
MATLAB®, and it is a mathematical platform that many institutional
quantitative strategists and portfolio managers use. Therefore, I will
demonstrate how to backtest the majority of strategies using MAT-
LAB. In fact, I have included a brief tutorial in the appendix on how

all the needed data before the market opens each day and how you
can optimize your operational procedures in actual execution.

COMMON BACKTESTING PITFALLS
TO AVOID
Backtesting is the process of creating the historical trades given the
historical information available at that time, and then ﬁnding out
what the subsequent performance of those trades is. This process
seems easy given that the trades were made using a computer algo-
rithm in our case, but there are numerous ways in which it can go
wrong. Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical

High-End Backtesting Platforms
In case you do have the ﬁnancial resources to purchase a high-end,
institutional-grade backtesting platform, here is a partial list:

range of markets including futures, equities, and currencies. Exam-

complete backtesting and order submission platform. If you back-
tested on such a platform, then it is trivial to conﬁgure it so that
the program will submit real orders to your account. This dispenses
with the need to write your own software, whether for backtesting
or for automated execution. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 3,
the drawback of such proprietary systems is that they are seldom as
ﬂexible as a general-purpose programming language like MATLAB

TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) is familiar to many retail
traders as a brokerage that provides all-in-one backtesting and trade

CHAPTER 2
Fishing for Ideas
Where Can We Find
Good Strategies?
T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actuallynot the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as

Since this book is about starting a quantitative trading business from
scratch, and not about starting a hedge fund that manages multiple
millions of dollars, we should not be concerned whether a strategy
is one that can absorb multiple millions of dollars. (Capacityis the
technical term for how much a strategy can absorb without nega-
tively impacting its returns.) In fact, quite the opposite—you should
look for those strategies that ﬂy under the radar of most institutional
investors, for example, strategies that have very low capacities be-
cause they trade too often, strategies that trade very few stocks ev-
ery day, or strategies that have very infrequent positions (such as
some seasonal trades in commodity futures described in Chapter 7).
Those niches are the ones that are likely still to be proﬁtable because
they have not yet been completely arbitraged away by the gigantic
hedge funds.

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat -
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
   In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com -
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
   The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa -
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

higher level than longer-term strategies can, and this high leverage
in turn boosts the return-on-equity of the strategy to often strato-
spheric levels.
Of course, the law of large numbers does not explain why a
particular high-frequency strategy has positive mean return in the
ﬁrst place. In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-
frequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such
strategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-
verting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral
pair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-
eral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in
the market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.
Unlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals
where the market environment can experience upheavals during the
lifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist
day to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The

Forex Strategies Based on Trading Style
   Portfolio trading, which can also be called basket trading, is based on the combination of different 
assets belonging to different financial markets (Forex, stock, futures, etc.).
   The concept behind portfolio trading is diversification, one of the most popular means of risk re -
duction. By a smart asset allocation traders protect themselves from market volatility, reduce the risk 
extent and keep the profit balance.
   It’s very important to create a diversified portfolio to reach your trading goal. Otherwise, this kind 
of strategy will be aimless.
   Currently IFC Markets offers a new method, called GeWorko Method, which makes it even much 
easier for you to perform portfolio trading. The method provides numerous opportunities for traders 
to take the highest profit from trade. By Geworko Method you can create portfolios starting from 
only two assets up to hundreds of different financial instruments, open both long and short positions 
within a portfolio, view the assets’ price history stretching up to 40 years, create your own PCIs, use 
a wide variety of market analysis tools, apply different trading strategies and constantly optimize and 
rebalance your portfolio. In other words, GeWorko Method seems the integrity of all trading opportu-
nities and strategies, through which you can organize your trade in the way you desire, develop the

Technical indicators are calculations which are based on the price and volume of a security. They 
are used both to confirm the trend and the quality of chart patterns, and to help traders determine the 
buy and sell signals.The indicators can be applied separately to form buy and sell signals, as well as 
can be used together, in conjunction with chart patterns and price movement.
Technical analysis indicators can form buy and sell signals through crossovers and divergence. 
Crossovers are reflected when price moves through the moving average or when two different 
moving averages cross each other. Divergence happens when the price trend and the indicator 
trend move in opposite directions indicating that the direction of price trend is weakening.

Forex technical analysis is the study of market action primarily through the use of charts for the 
purpose of forecasting future price trends. Forex traders can develop strategies based on various 
technical analysis tools including market trend, volume, range,support and resistance levels, chart 
patterns and indicators, as well as conduct a Multiple Time Frame Analysis using different time-
frame charts.
Technical analysis strategy is a crucial method of evaluating assets based on the analysis and 
statistics of past market action, such as past prices and past volume. The main goal of technical 
analysts is not the measuring of asset’s underlying value, they attempt to use charts or other tools 
of technical analysis to determine patterns that will help to forecast future market activity. Their firm 
belief is that the future performance of markets can be indicated by the historical performance.

The Supertrend indicator has carved a niche in the realm of technical analysis as a straightforward yet effective tool for
identifying trends. Built upon the foundation of the Average True Range (ATR), it constructs a dynamic line that adapts
to market volatility, offering visual cues regarding the prevailing market direction (Sahoo et al. [2017]).

itable technique and support the efﬁcient market hypothe-
sis. Part of the problem of the studies during the 60s was
the ad hoc speciﬁcations of the trading rules that led to data
snooping. Ex post speciﬁcation of rules may have led to
biased studies. Recently, Allen and Karjalainen [3] found
proﬁtable trading rules using genetic algorithm for the S&P
500 with daily prices from 1928 to 1995. However, these
rules were not consistently better than a buy-and-hold strat-
egy in the out-of-sample test periods.
In the last years, there has been a growing interest
on applying machine learning methods to formulate trad-
ing strategies using technical indicators such as the follow-
ing: Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang [53], who used nonparamet-
ric kernel regression for technical pattern recognition of a
large number of stocks for the period 1962 - 1996, found
that technical indicators provide incremental information
for investors comparing the unconditional empirical distri-
bution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution
on speciﬁc technical indicators such as head and shoulders.
Moody and Saffell [54] found that a trading system us-
ing direct reinforcement learning outperforms a Q-trader
for the asset allocation problem between the S&P 500 and
T-bill. Dempster et al. [25] compared four methods for
foreign exchange trading (reinforcement learning, genetic
algorithm, Markov chain linear programming, and simple
heuristic) and concluded that a combination of technical

deﬁne these indicators in this appendix and provide the ba-
sic intuition that motivates them. Throughout this section
we assume a single ﬁxed stock.
We start with some basic mathematical notation. We
index the trading days by t = 1,2,... . We denote by
Po
t,Pc
t,Puc
t ,Ph
t, and Pl
t, the open, adjusted close, unad-
justed close11, high, and low price of the tth trading day.
We eliminate the lower index when we wish to refer to
the whole sequence, i.e. Pc refers to the whole sequence
Pc
1,Pc
2,... .
Many of the technical indicators incorporate time av-
erages of prices or of other indicators. We use two types
of time averages, the simple moving average and the ex-
ponentially weighted moving average. 12 Let X denote a
time sequence X1,X2,... . The simple moving averageis
deﬁned as
SMAt(X,n) = 1
n
n−1∑
s=0
Xt−s ,
and the exponentially weighted moving averageis de-
ﬁned as
EMAt(X,n) =λ
∞∑
s=0
(1 −λ)sXt−s; λ= 2
n+ 1.
A useful property of EMAt(X,n) is that it can be calcu-
lated using a simple update rule:
EMAt(X,n) =λXt + (1−λ)EMAt−1(X,n) .
We name as “rule” and follow by an identiﬁcation
number the most common rules associated with each indi-
cator. Most of the buy and sell signals are generated when
the value of an indicator crosses some threshold or the
value of another indicator. The input to our learning sys-
tem includes both signals and indicators. We use normal-
ized indicators, by which we mean indicators whose value

   They can be applied separately to form buy and sell signals, as well as can be used together, in 
conjunction with the market. However, not all of them are used widely by traders. The following in -
dicators mentioned below are of utmost importance for analysts and at least one of them is used by 
each trader to develop his trading strategy:
  
   Moving Average
   Bollinger Bands
   Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   Stochastic Oscillator
   Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
   RSI-Bars
   ADX
   Momentum
   You can easily learn how to use each indicator and develop trading strategies by indicators.
Technical analysis indicators can form buy and sell signals through crossovers and divergence. 
Crossovers are reflected when price moves through the moving average or when two different 
moving averages cross each other. Divergence happens when the price trend and the indicator 
trend move in opposite directions indicating that the direction of price trend is weakening.

cator. Most of the buy and sell signals are generated when
the value of an indicator crosses some threshold or the
value of another indicator. The input to our learning sys-
tem includes both signals and indicators. We use normal-
ized indicators, by which we mean indicators whose value
does not change if all the prices in the sequence are multi-
plied by a constant factor. This is important when working
with adjusted stock prices.
Additionally, we recalculate a selected group of indi-
cators and their rules with three different values of the main
parameters that are close to the industry practice. So, our
learning system should be able to select the optimal com-
bination of indicators and parameters. Additionally, we in-
clude ratios of the indicators which generally are calculated
as the indicator divided by its moving average. Most of
these ratios are part of the trading rules. However, we in-
clude the ratios by themselves so that our learning system
ﬁnds its own rules. Finally, there are indicators that do not

indicators. Additional useful references about technical analysis and trad-
ing are [44, 55, 16, 59, 60, 26, 18].

ment theories or statistical assumptions. Our algorithm also
combines different recommendations of experts or “artiﬁ-
cial” fund managers. However, the deﬁnition of experts
and their combination is completely different of how it is
done in CUP. Our algorithm is based on a learning algo-
rithm and has an online learning capacity that assigns dif-
ferent weights according to the performance of its experts.
As a result, the portfolio is reallocated based on the risk ad-
justed return of its underlying assets, and the combination
of experts’ forecasts.
1.2 Trading strategies and technical analysis
Another important line of research in the trading algorith-
mic literature is the use of learning algorithms to generate
trading rules using technical analysis indicators. Technical
analysis or technical trading strategies try to exploit statis-
tically measurable short-term market opportunities, such as
trend spotting, and momentum, in individual industrial sec-
tors (e.g. ﬁnancial, pharmaceutical etc.).
The presence of technical analysis has been very lim-
ited in the ﬁnance literature because of its lack of a solid
statistical or mathematical foundation, its highly subjec-
tive nature, and its visual nature. In the 60s and 70s re-
searchers studied trading rules based on technical indica-
tors and did not ﬁnd them proﬁtable [1] [31]. These ﬁnd-
ings led Fama [30] to dismiss technical analysis as a prof-
itable technique and support the efﬁcient market hypothe-

• High and low: These are the highest and lowest prices of the asset during a specified time frame.
2.1.2 Advantages
• Simplicity: The Supertrend indicator boasts a straightforward calculation, making it readily interpretable for
traders of all experience levels [Sahoo et al., 2017].
• Trend Identification: It’s dynamic nature allows for effective identification of both uptrends (price consistently
above the Supertrend line) and downtrends (price consistently below the Supertrend line) [Bhuiyan et al.,

• Reduced False Signals: Compared to some other trend-following indicators, the Supertrend may generate
fewer false signals due to its incorporation of the ATR, which helps account for volatility .
2.1.3 Limitations:
• Lagging Indicator: The Supertrend indicator, like most technical indicators, is inherently backward-looking,
relying on past price data to generate signals. This can lead to delayed entry and exit points, particularly during
volatile market environments [Sahoo et al., 2017]
• Whipsaws: During periods of increased market volatility, the Supertrend indicator may generate whipsaws,
where the price oscillates above and below the Supertrend line, leading to unnecessary trades and potential
losses.
• Parameter Sensitivity: The Supertrend indicator’s performance is heavily influenced by the chosen atr multiplier
and atr period. Finding the optimal settings can be challenging and may require experimentation or optimization
techniques [Bhuiyan et al., 2016].

Appendix. Investment signals for automated
trading system
Technical indicators are statistics of the market that quan-
tify market trends. Most technical indicators have been de-
veloped by professional traders using trial and error. It is
common practice to use rules based on technical indicators
to choose the timing of buy and sell orders. These rules
are called buy and sell “signals”. In this work we use a
combination of market indicators and trading signals. We

value of another indicator. The input to our learning sys-
tem includes both signals and indicators. We use normal-
ized indicators, by which we mean indicators whose value
does not change if all the prices in the sequence are multi-
plied by a constant factor. This is important when working
with adjusted stock prices.
Additionally, we recalculate a selected group of indi-
cators and their rules with three different values of the main
parameters that are close to the industry practice. So, our

1.2 Trading strategies and technical analysis
Another important line of research in the trading algorith-
mic literature is the use of learning algorithms to generate
trading rules using technical analysis indicators. Technical
analysis or technical trading strategies try to exploit statis-
tically measurable short-term market opportunities, such as
trend spotting, and momentum, in individual industrial sec-
tors (e.g. ﬁnancial, pharmaceutical etc.).

parameters that are close to the industry practice. So, our
learning system should be able to select the optimal com-
bination of indicators and parameters. Additionally, we in-
clude ratios of the indicators which generally are calculated
as the indicator divided by its moving average. Most of
these ratios are part of the trading rules. However, we in-
clude the ratios by themselves so that our learning system
ﬁnds its own rules. Finally, there are indicators that do not

rules were not consistently better than a buy-and-hold strat-
egy in the out-of-sample test periods.
In the last years, there has been a growing interest
on applying machine learning methods to formulate trad-
ing strategies using technical indicators such as the follow-
ing: Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang [53], who used nonparamet-
ric kernel regression for technical pattern recognition of a
large number of stocks for the period 1962 - 1996, found

Example of the use of this methodology
I report the following practical example; the figure shows the trend of a hypothetical stock. The 
value of this stock on a thousand time intervals rises one unit 60% of the time and goes down by one 
unit 40% of the time. In order to simplify the calculations the price movement is unitary. Now let us 
look at two strategies that execute 500 trades, each trade lasts an interval of time. The first strategy 
execute only buys  and in order to choose when to buy, flips a coin, if it win opens a trades if loses 
it waits for the next unit of time and repeats the operation. The second strategy, on the other hand, 
is a strategy that sells only, but does not do it in a random way, it uses information that allows it a 
10% advantage in determining the drops of the value stock.
The first strategy gets a profit of 100 by winning 60% of trades. Now we calculate the probability 
of obtaining a better result in a random way, to do this we use the binomial cumulative distribution 
function with the following parameters:
p = 60% (probability of win)

higher level than longer-term strategies can, and this high leverage
in turn boosts the return-on-equity of the strategy to often strato-
spheric levels.
Of course, the law of large numbers does not explain why a
particular high-frequency strategy has positive mean return in the
ﬁrst place. In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-
frequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such
strategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-
verting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral
pair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-
eral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in
the market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.
Unlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals
where the market environment can experience upheavals during the
lifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist
day to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The

of achieving better results with the random strategy described above. The results for the L values 
ranging from 10 to 200 are shown in Figure 1. Looking at the figure, we see how the probability 
tends asymptotically toward 50%. Therefore, we have a 50% chance of getting better or worse 
results. Basically, the strategy described in the paradox tends asymptotically toward a random 
strategy. Consequently, the doubling -down strategy turns out to be a strategy that does not 
implement useful information for improving our likelihood of victory. Thus, using the cognitive 
aspect as a method of evaluation has proven the irrationality of the strategy. 
 
 We use very similar approaches, where the strategy being evaluated is compared with an 
equivalent random strategy, in the financial field to analyse the results generated by a trading

sition overnight. Many of the early high-frequency strategies were
applied to the foreign exchange market, and then later on to the fu-
tures market, because of their abundance of liquidity. In the last six
or seven years, however, with the increasing liquidity in the equity
market, the availability of historical tick database for stocks, and
mushrooming computing power, this type of strategies has become
widespread for stock trading as well.
The reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:
Based on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,
the smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will
experience. With high-frequency trading, one can potentially place
hundreds if not thousands of bets all in one day. Therefore, pro-
vided the strategy is sound and generates positive mean return, you
can expect the day-to-day deviation from this return to be minimal.
With this high Sharpe ratio, one can increase the leverage to a much

20 QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Now that you know what a Sharpe ratio is, you may want to
ﬁnd out what kind of Sharpe ratio your candidate strategies have.
Often, they are not reported by the authors of that strategy, and you
will have to e-mail them in private for this detail. And often, they
will oblige, especially if the authors are ﬁnance professors; but if
they refuse, you have no choice but to perform the backtest yourself.
Sometimes, however, you can still make an educated guess based on
the ﬂimsiest of information:
r If a strategy trades only a few times a year, chances are its
Sharpe ratio won’t be high. This does not prevent it from being
part of your multistrategy trading business, but it does disqualify
the strategy from being your main proﬁt center.
r If a strategy has deep (e.g., more than 10 percent) or lengthy
(e.g., four or more months) drawdowns, it is unlikely that it will
have a high Sharpe ratio. I will explain the concept of drawdown
in the next section, but you can just visually inspect the equity
curve (which is also the cumulative proﬁt-and-loss curve, assum-
ing no redemption or cash infusion) to see if it is very bumpy
or not. Any peak-to-trough of that curve is a drawdown. (See
Figure 2.1 for an example.)

proﬁts, and therefore it is the levered, compounded growth rate that
is of ultimate importance.)
One approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-
tribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,
with a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should
be net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)
This is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite
inaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with
far higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-
tudes) than Gaussian probability distributions will allow. However,
every scientiﬁc or engineering endeavor starts with the simplest
model with the crudest approximation, and ﬁnance is no excep-
tion. I will discuss the remedies to such inaccuracies later in this
chapter.
Let’s denote the optimal fractions of your equity that you should
allocate to each of yourn strategies by a column vectorF∗ = ( f ∗

Given our optimization objective and the Gaussian assumption,
