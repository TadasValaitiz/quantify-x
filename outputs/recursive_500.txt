to use for your strategy.
MINIMIZING TRANSACTION COSTS
We saw in Chapter 3 how transaction costs can impact a strategy’s
actual return. Besides changing your brokerage or proprietary trad-
ing ﬁrm to one that charges a lower commission, there are a few
things you can do in your execution method to minimize the trans-
action costs.
To cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-



vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on



domestic and international markets.

By harnessing the combined strengths of the Supertrend indicator and Bayesian optimization, this thesis aspires to
unveil the potential for enhanced profitability within the algorithmic trading landscape. Further explored whether BO

Simulate the trading strategy based on Supertrend buy/sell signals.
Evaluate the backtesting performance using metrics like profit factor, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.
Evaluation and Refinement
Analyze the backtesting results and consider incorporating additional filters or risk management techniques.
Refine the objective function or BO parameters if necessary.

• Global Optimization: BO avoids getting stuck in local optima by balancing exploration and exploitation during
the search process.
• Data-Driven Approach: BO leverages past evaluations to improve its understanding of the objective function
and guide the search towards better solutions.
2.2.3 Importance in Algorithmic Trading:



from the data itself, govern how a trading strategy operates. In the context of the Supertrend indicator, the atr multiplier
and atr period are prime examples of hyperparameters. Identifying their optimal settings is paramount for maximizing a
strategy’s effectiveness [Osório et al., 2020].
Traditional optimization methods, such as grid search or random search, can be employed to explore the parameter



extent and keep the profit balance.
   It’s very important to create a diversified portfolio to reach your trading goal. Otherwise, this kind 
of strategy will be aimless.
   Currently IFC Markets offers a new method, called GeWorko Method, which makes it even much 
easier for you to perform portfolio trading. The method provides numerous opportunities for traders 
to take the highest profit from trade. By Geworko Method you can create portfolios starting from

backtesting. Just like the academic studies, the strategies from
traders’ forums may have worked only for a little while, or they
work for only a certain class of stocks, or they work only if you
don’t factor in transaction costs. However, the trick is that you
can often modify the basic strategy and make it proﬁtable. (Many
of these caveats as well as a few common variations on a basic
