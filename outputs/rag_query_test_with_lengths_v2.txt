Forex trading strategies can be developed by following popular trading styles which are day trad­
ing, carry trade, buy and hold strategy, hedging, portfolio trading, spread trading, swing trading, 
order trading and algorithmic trading.
Using and developing trading strategies mostly depends on understanding your strengths and 
weaknesses.In order to be successful in trade you should find the best way of trading that suits your 
personality.There is no fixed “right” way of trading; the right way for others may not work for you. 
Below you can read about each trading style and define your own.

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat­
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com­
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa­
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

This book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-
tive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about
speciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-
ample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-
stead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy
yourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how
to reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical
performance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain

proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.
The book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that
traders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-
ness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-
ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing
the money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this
strategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of
important advanced concepts with which most professional quan-
titative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with
reﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how
they can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that
contains a tutorial on using MATLAB.

Order trading helps traders to enter or exit a position at the most suitable moment by using differ­
ent orders including market orders, pending orders, limit orders, stop orders, stop loss orders and 
OCO orders.
Currently, advanced trading platforms provide various types of orders in trading which are not 
simply ‘’buy button’’ and ‘’sell button’’. Each type of trading order can represent a specific strategy.  
It’s important to know when and how to trade and which order to use in a given situation in order to 
develop the right order strategy.
The most popular Forex orders that a trader can apply in his trade are:

Portfolio trading, which can also be called basket trading, is based on the combination of different 
assets belonging to different financial markets (Forex, stock, futures, etc.).
The concept behind portfolio trading is diversification, one of the most popular means of risk re­
duction. By a smart asset allocation traders protect themselves from market volatility, reduce the risk 
extent and keep the profit balance.
It’s very important to create a diversified portfolio to reach your trading goal. Otherwise, this kind 
of strategy will be aimless.
You should compile your portfolio with such securities (currencies, stocks, commodities, indi­
ces) which are not strictly correlated, meaning that their returns do not move up and down in a 
perfect unison. By mixing up different assets in your portfolio which are in negative correlation, 
with one security’s price going up and the other’s going down you can keep the portfolio’s bal­
ance, hence preserving your profit and reducing the risk.
Currently IFC Markets offers a new method, called GeWorko Method, which makes it even much 
easier for you to perform portfolio trading. The method provides numerous opportunities for traders 
to take the highest profit from trade. By Geworko Method you can create portfolios starting from 
only two assets up to hundreds of different financial instruments, open both long and short positions 
within a portfolio, view the assets’ price history stretching up to 40 years, create your own PCIs, use 
a wide variety of market analysis tools, apply different trading strategies and constantly optimize and 
rebalance your portfolio. In other words, GeWorko Method seems the integrity of all trading opportu­
nities and strategies, through which you can organize your trade in the way you desire, develop the 
strategy you want and what is the most important, stay safe from sudden and tragic losses.d tragic 
losses.

n this chapter, we will be taking a break from the technical as-
pect of trading to focus on the business side of it. Assuming that
your goal is to remain an independent trader and not work for
a money management institution, the choice of the business struc-
ture for trading is important. The main choice you have to make is
whether to open a retail brokerage account or to join a proprietary
trading ﬁrm. The next step is to determine what features of the bro-
kerage or trading ﬁrm are important to you. Finally, you have to de-
cide what kind of physical trading infrastructure you need in order
to execute your quantitative strategy.

T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actually not the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as
historical fundamental data). Furthermore, many of these academic

Range trading strategy, which is also called channel trading, is generally associated with the lack 
of market direction and it is used during the absence of a trend. Range trading identifies currency 
price movement in channels and the first task of this strategy is to find the range. This process can 
be carried out by connecting a series of highs and lows with a horizontal trendline. In other words, 
the trader should find the major support and resistance levels with the area in between known as 
“trading range”.

If you are convinced that you want to become a quantitative trader,
a number of questions immediately follow: How do you ﬁnd the right
strategy to trade? How do you recognize a good versus a bad strat-
egy even before devoting any time to backtesting them? How do you
rigorously backtest them? If the backtest performance is good, what
steps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both
the business structure and the technological infrastructure? If the
strategy is proﬁtable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale
up the capital to make it into a growing income stream while manag-
ing the inevitable (but, hopefully, only occasional) losses that come
with trading? These nuts and bolts of quantitative trading will be
tackled in Chapters 2 through 6.
Though the list of processes to go through in order to get to the
ﬁnal destination of sustained and growing proﬁtability may seem
long and daunting, in reality it may be faster and easier than many
other businesses. When I ﬁrst started as an independent trader, it
took me only three months to ﬁnd and backtest my ﬁrst new strat-
egy, set up a new brokerage account with $100,000 capital, imple-
ment the execution system, and start trading the strategy. The strat-
egy immediately became proﬁtable in the ﬁrst month. Back in the
dot-com era, I started an Internet software ﬁrm. It took about 3 times
more investment, 5 times more human-power, and 24 times longer
to ﬁnd out that the business model didn’t work, whereupon all in-
vestors including myself lost 100 percent of their investments. Com-
pared to that experience, it really has been a breeze trading quanti-
tatively and proﬁtably.

Forex Strategies Based on Trading Style
   Portfolio trading, which can also be called basket trading, is based on the combination of different 
assets belonging to different financial markets (Forex, stock, futures, etc.).

duction. By a smart asset allocation traders protect themselves from market volatility, reduce the risk

trade on my own, I worried that I would be cut off from the ﬂow
of trading ideas from my colleagues and mentors. But then I found
out that one of the best ways to gather and share trading ideas is
to start your own trading blog—for every trading “secret” that you
divulge to the world, you will be rewarded with multiple ones from
your readers. (The person who suggested the Wealth-Lab strategy to
me was a reader who works 12 time zones away. If it weren’t for my
blog, there was little chance that I would have met him and bene-
ﬁted from his suggestion.) In fact, what you thought of as secrets
are more often than not well-known ideas to many others! What
truly make a strategy proprietary and its secrets worth protecting
are the tricks and variations that you have come up with, not the
plain vanilla version.
Furthermore, your bad ideas will quickly get shot down by your
online commentators, thus potentially saving you from major losses.
After I glowingly described a seasonal stock-trading strategy on
my blog that was developed by some ﬁnance professors, a reader
promptly went ahead and backtested that strategy and reported that
it didn’t work. (See my blog entry, “Seasonal Trades in Stocks,”
at epchan.blogspot.com/2007/11/seasonal-trades-in-stocks.html and

Forex Strategies Based on Trading Style
   Carry trade allows to make a profit from the non-volatile and stable market, since here it rather 
matters the difference between the interest rates of currencies; the higher the difference, the greater 
the profit. While deciding what currencies to trade by this strategy you should consider the expected 
changes in the interest rates of particular currencies.
   However, this does not mean that the price changes between the currencies are absolutely unim-
portant. Thus, you can invest in a currency because of its high interest rate, but if the currency price 
drops and you close the trade, you may find that even though you have profited from the interest 
rate you have also lost from the trade because of the difference in the buy/sell price. Therefore, carry 
trade is mostly suitable for trendless or sideways market, when the price movement is expected to 
remain the same for some time.
Carry Trade Strategy
Carry trade is a strategy through which a trader borrows a currency in a low interest country, 
converts it into a currency in a high interest rate country and invests it in high grade debt secu-
rities of that country. 
Investors who follow this strategy borrow money at a low interest rate to invest in a security that 
is expected to provide higher return.
The principle is simple- buy a currency whose interest rate is expected to go up and sell the 
currency whose interest rate is expected to go down.

Your Programming Skills
Are you good at programming? If you know some programming
languages such as Visual Basic or even Java, C#, or C++, you can
explore high-frequency strategies, and you can also trade a large
number of securities. Otherwise, settle for strategies that trade only
once a day, or trade just a few stocks, futures, or currencies. (This
constraint may be overcome if you don’t mind the expense of hiring
a software contractor. Again, see Chapter 5 for more details.)

every day lasted about two to three minutes with one ex-
pert and about eight to ten minutes with the eleven experts
that we had in total.
We aggregated the daily results in 20 test sets (2,000
observations per set equivalent to 20 trading days) that we
used to calculate the performance and risk indicators. The
average of these results are presented in the next section.
We ran the expert weighting algorithm using its three ver-
sions and the following values of the parameter C: 0, 0.05,
0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. When C is 0 is equiv-
alent to apply bagging to Logitboost (bagged boosting) or
to average all the experts. The threshold to eliminate very
weak expert weights (γ0) is set to 0.20, and the threshold
to restrict trading (γ1) is set to 0.
We tested our results with transaction costs of $0,
$0.001, $0.002, and $0.003 per stock. These values are
realistic if we consider that ISLAND has the policy to pay
a rebate of $0.002 per stock to the trader whose order was
in the order books, and charges a rebate of $0.003 per stock
to the trader that submitted the incoming order. Traders can
use this policy in their favour and do not have to pay the full
fee of $0.003. On the contrary, they can capture the rebate
using only limit orders as the market maker strategy sug-
gests. Even more, large brokerage ﬁrms have much lower
direct transaction costs and the initial investment to trade
becomes a sink cost that does not have a major impact in
individual trades.
We compare our results with a buy and hold (B&H)
position, a constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP), and
Cover’s universal portfolio (CUP) algorithm.
CRP and
CUP are implemented with uniform distributions, and with
10 different portfolios for the case of CUP9.

Due to the high complexity in neural networks, they have a tendency to
overﬁt to the given training data, which yields poor generalization to unseen
data points.
To overcome this problem, several regularization techniques
have been proposed. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this is often equal to in-
troducing an informative prior on the weights, and ﬁnding the optimal set
of weights via Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) [3]. More formally,
given a data set D and a prior distribution of the weights, p(w), the optimal
set of weights is estimated by
wMAP = arg max
w (log p(D|w) + log p(w)) .

• Hyperparameter Tuning: BO excels at optimizing hyperparameters in algorithmic trading strategies, such as
the atr_multiplier and atr_period of the Supertrend indicator. By finding the optimal settings, BO can
potentially enhance the strategy’s performance and profitability.
• Portfolio Allocation: BO can be applied to optimize portfolio allocation across various assets, balancing risk
and return based on historical data and market conditions.
• Risk Management: BO can be used to optimize risk management parameters, such as stop-loss and take-profit
levels, helping to mitigate potential losses.

difference when we used only four different variations of
the parameters. So, we included four different versions of
most of the technical indicators in our training, validation,
and testing set. In total, each instance of the training, val-
idation, and testing set had 112 inputs. We were able to
use this approach because of the boosting’s feature selec-
tion capability (see the appendix for a presentation of the
parameters used).
In our experiments we observed that a small change in
the sample may lead to diferent ADTs changing the invest-
ment recommendation. In order to prevent this problem,
our algorithm generates different ADTs and, in the next
layer, selects the output of the best ADTs.

Layer 2:
Online learning and expert

Figure 4. Trading system as a process ﬂow. The inputs
of the algorithm are price series that are transformed into
technical indicators and trading rules. The ﬁrst component
trains several ADTs (experts) and each of them generates
an investment signal. The second layer weights the invest-

investment signal for each stock using an online learning
algorithm. The third layer ﬁlters the weak investment sig-
nals, and restricts not proﬁtable trading strategies.
sis. We calculated these indicators using R and its ﬁnancial
engineering package called Rmetrics.6
We improved the performance of the boosting algorithm
by adding online learning capacity with expert weighting.
Our algorithm is derived from a previous algorithm pro-
posed by Freund, Manssour and Schapire [34] that predicts
with a exponentially weighted average of the training er-
ror of all hypotheses. The “exponential weights” formula
comes from the weighted majority algorithm introduced by
Littlestone and Warmuth [52] and further studied by Cesa-
Bianchi et al. [12]. The “exponential weights” is a different
formula to compute the posterior distribution as it would
be proposed by Bayesian analysis. An interesting feature
of this algorithm is that it abstains to predict on certain in-
stances, so the predictions that it makes are very reliable.
The algorithm that we present in the next subsection is
an extension of this original algorithm applied to ﬁnancial
time series prediction, and therefore is an online learning
model.8 The machine learning layer introduced in the pre-
vious section and the online learning layer of our trading
system have two different functions:
• The machine learning layer generates several “ex-
perts” or ADTs using historical stock price informa-
tion. Each ADT has a set of rules that combines the
technical indicators, and generates an investment sig-
nal for each stock.
• The online learning layer receives the new prices,
combines the signals of the different ADTs gener-
ated by the machine learning layer, and reallocates
the portfolio according to the recommendations of the
“experts”, and the input received from the risk man-
agement module (see section 3.3.1).
In the next section, we describe the algorithm used by the
online learning layer.
Our goal was to predict the trend of beta excess
returns (BXRET)7 using the above investment signals.
yt ∈[−1, +1] is the binary label to be predicted where 1
represents the expectation of a positive beta excess return,
and -1 otherwise.
A major problem with the use of technical indica-
tors is their calibration or the adequate selection of their
best parameters, as with the optimal number of days to
calculate the moving averages used by stochastic indica-
tors or the number of standard deviations used to calcu-
late the Bollinger bands. There are many versions of op-
timizers such as the “brute force” approach where all the
alternatives are tested one-at-a-time, and simulated anneal-
ing or genetic optimizers as suggested by Katz and Mc-
Cormick [44]. In our case, we initially tried one-at-a-time
optimization where each parameter was tested with several
values while keeping the others constant. We found that
this approach was very inefﬁcient because it required too
much computer power and time.
The solution that we implemented was the simulta-
neous recalculation of the technical indicators with several
values of their parameters. Then the boosting algorithm
would select the best combination of parameters and tech-
nical indicators. Our initial parameters were the parame-
ters recommended in the literature. We tested 16 different
variations of the initial parameters and did not ﬁnd a major

7Beta excess return is the excess return of a speciﬁc asset less the av-
erage return of all assets in its beta portfolio for each trading date.
8Borodin and El-Yaniv [11, 28] propose a different approach to use
online learning for trading and portfolio selection. They measure the per-
formance of their trading algorithm in relation to a “statistical adversary”,
and an optimal ofﬂine algorithm.

tion of CPU cycles includes more hyper-parameter exploration than has been typical in the machine
learning literature.
Hyper-parameter optimization is the problem of optimizing a loss function over a graph-structured
conﬁguration space. In this work we restrict ourselves to tree-structured conﬁguration spaces. Con-
ﬁguration spaces are tree-structured in the sense that some leaf variables (e.g. the number of hidden
units in the 2nd layer of a DBN) are only well-deﬁned when node variables (e.g. a discrete choice of
how many layers to use) take particular values. Not only must a hyper-parameter optimization algo-
rithm optimize over variables which are discrete, ordinal, and continuous, but it must simultaneously
choose which variables to optimize.
In this work we deﬁne a conﬁguration space by a generative process for drawing valid samples.
Random search is the algorithm of drawing hyper-parameter assignments from that process and
evaluating them. Optimization algorithms work by identifying hyper-parameter assignments that
could have been drawn, and that appear promising on the basis of the loss function’s value at other
points. This paper makes two contributions: 1) Random search is competitive with the manual
optimization of DBNs in [1], and 2) Automatic sequential optimization outperforms both manual
and random search.
Section 2 covers sequential model-based optimization, and the expected improvement criterion. Sec-
tion 3 introduces a Gaussian Process based hyper-parameter optimization algorithm. Section 4 in-
troduces a second approach based on adaptive Parzen windows. Section 5 describes the problem of
DBN hyper-parameter optimization, and shows the efﬁciency of random search. Section 6 shows
the efﬁciency of sequential optimization on the two hardest datasets according to random search.
The paper concludes with discussion of results and concluding remarks in Section 7 and Section 8.

This chapter introduces artiﬁcial neural networks in a frequentist setting,
describing the relevant concepts for introducing Bayesian neural networks.
We present relevant regularization techniques, network architectures and ac-
tivation functions.
Neural networks have in recent times gained signiﬁcant attention, due
to their advancements in ﬁelds such as image recognition, natural language
processing and reinforcement learning. With developments in optimization,
learning algorithms and hardware, neural networks continue to gain momen-
tum. However, there are a number of problems that have not been properly
addressed. Despite their performance on some data sets, neural networks
tend to easily overﬁt to training data and provide poor generalization. Fi-
nally, they require tuning of a large amount of model hyperparameters.
A neural network is a parametric model that aims to approximate the
mapping f : X →Y, given a data set D = {xi, yi} ⊂(X, Y). The set of
parameters of the neural network is called weights w, and the problem of
ﬁnding the set of weights that best approximate the mapping f is solved via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
wMLE = arg max
w (log p(D|w)) .

and -1 otherwise.
A major problem with the use of technical indica-
tors is their calibration or the adequate selection of their
best parameters, as with the optimal number of days to
calculate the moving averages used by stochastic indica-
tors or the number of standard deviations used to calcu-
late the Bollinger bands. There are many versions of op-
timizers such as the “brute force” approach where all the
alternatives are tested one-at-a-time, and simulated anneal-
ing or genetic optimizers as suggested by Katz and Mc-
Cormick [44]. In our case, we initially tried one-at-a-time
optimization where each parameter was tested with several
values while keeping the others constant. We found that
this approach was very inefﬁcient because it required too
much computer power and time.
The solution that we implemented was the simulta-
neous recalculation of the technical indicators with several
values of their parameters. Then the boosting algorithm
would select the best combination of parameters and tech-
nical indicators. Our initial parameters were the parame-
ters recommended in the literature. We tested 16 different
variations of the initial parameters and did not ﬁnd a major

Abstract
Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classiﬁcation benchmarks
have come from better conﬁgurations of existing techniques rather than novel ap-
proaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been
the job of humans because they can be very efﬁcient in regimes where only a few
trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it pos-
sible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can ﬁnd better
results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neu-
ral networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters
using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the ex-
pected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufﬁciently
efﬁcient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreli-
able for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difﬁcult
DBN learning problems from [1] and ﬁnd signiﬁcantly better results than the best

We aggregated the daily results in 20 test sets (2,000
observations per set equivalent to 20 trading days) that we
used to calculate the performance and risk indicators. The
average of these results are presented in the next section.
We ran the expert weighting algorithm using its three ver-
sions and the following values of the parameter C: 0, 0.05,
0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. When C is 0 is equiv-
alent to apply bagging to Logitboost (bagged boosting) or
to average all the experts. The threshold to eliminate very
weak expert weights ( γ0) is set to 0.20, and the threshold
to restrict trading (γ1) is set to 0.
We tested our results with transaction costs of $0,
$0.001, $0.002, and $0.003 per stock. These values are
realistic if we consider that ISLAND has the policy to pay
a rebate of $0.002 per stock to the trader whose order was
in the order books, and charges a rebate of $0.003 per stock
to the trader that submitted the incoming order. Traders can
use this policy in their favour and do not have to pay the full
fee of $0.003. On the contrary, they can capture the rebate
using only limit orders as the market maker strategy sug-

STRATEGY REFINEMENT
If a strategy does not deliver superb backtest performance on ﬁrst
trial, there are some common ways to improve it. How to reﬁne a
strategy without introducing data-snooping bias and to remain sim-
ple with few parameters is more of an art than a science. The guid-
ing principle is the same as that of parameter optimization: What-
ever changes you make to the strategy to improve its performance
on the training set, it must also improve the performance on the
test set.
Often, there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well
known in traders’ circles and are still somewhat proﬁtable, though
their returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trad-
ing of stocks. The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too
many traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and
gradually erasing the proﬁt margin. However, it is often possible to
introduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will boost its
returns.

values indicate improvement in profit after BO.Negative value suggests a decrease.
• The improvement percentage for Nifty 50 is N/A because the default profit was 0. Dividing by 0 is undefined.
8 Discussion and Conclusion
• Strategy Performance: The overall effectiveness of the BO-optimized Supertrend strategy can be determined by
analyzing the results in the table above. The values for most stocks are positive suggests that BO successfully
identified parameter combinations that improved the strategy’s performance compared to the default settings.
• BO Effectiveness: Based on the BO results (iteration tables, visualizations, convergence plots - shown above),
discusses how BO efficiently explored the search space and converged towards potentially optimal parameter
combinations for each Indian and international stock.
• BO Limitations:
– The effectiveness of BO is highly dependent on the chosen objective function and the quality of historical
data used for training.
– BO might get trapped in local optima if the search space is not well-defined or the objective function is
complex.
• Future Studies:
– Exploring the use of different BO algorithms or objective functions to potentially enhance optimization
results.
– Investigating to incorporate additional parameters into the optimization process for a more comprehensive
strategy fine-tuning.
– Testing the generalized ,ability of BO-optimized parameters across different market conditions using
forward testing.

where yi is the actual outcome and y∗
i is the model’s prediction. Using
MSE as loss function is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation using
a Gaussian likelihood for the data given the model’s parameters.
3.4 Regularization
Due to the high complexity in neural networks, they have a tendency to
overﬁt to the given training data, which yields poor generalization to unseen
data points. To overcome this problem, several regularization techniques
have been proposed. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this is often equal to in-
troducing an informative prior on the weights, and ﬁnding the optimal set
of weights via Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) [3]. More formally,
given a data set Dand a prior distribution of the weights, p(w), the optimal
set of weights is estimated by
wMAP = arg max
w
(log p(D|w) + logp(w)) . (3.5)
3.4.1 L1-regularization

in terms of absolute value (i.e. L1-norm), with a regularization parameter

where L(y∗|x∗,w) denotes the network’s loss function of a new prediction,
given data and trained weights. Large values of λ yields heavy regulariza-
tion, while small values result in no regularization. L1-regularization tends
to force parameters to equal zero, creating model sparsity. From a prob-
abilistic viewpoint, L1-regularization equals introducing a Laplace-prior on

the case of one asset which can easily be extended to N as-
sets. The ﬁnal outcome sequence are the net weights of an
asset (W = W1,W2,..,W t,...,W l) where Wt ∈[−1,1],
trefers to a time step and l represents the last step of the
sequence.
In this research, every expert is an ADT calculated
with the training set which is a sequence of pairs as intro-

by adding online learning capacity with expert weighting.
Our algorithm is derived from a previous algorithm pro-
posed by Freund, Manssour and Schapire [34] that predicts
with a exponentially weighted average of the training er-
ror of all hypotheses. The “exponential weights” formula

Backtesting is the process of creating the historical trades given the
historical information available at that time, and then ﬁnding out
what the subsequent performance of those trades is. This process
seems easy given that the trades were made using a computer algo-
rithm in our case, but there are numerous ways in which it can go
wrong. Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical
performance that is better than what we would have obtained in ac-
tual trading. We have already seen how survivorship bias in the data
used for backtesting can result in inﬂated performance. There are,

A key difference between a traditional investment management pro-
cess and a quantitative investment process is the possibility of back-
testing a quantitative investment strategy to see how it would have
performed in the past. Even if you found a strategy described in
complete detail with all the historical performance data available,
you would still need to backtest it yourself. This exercise serves
several purposes. If nothing else, this replication of the research will
ensure that you have understood the strategy completely and have
reproduced it exactly for implementation as a trading system. Just
as in any medical or scientiﬁc research, replicating others’ results
also ensures that the original research did not commit any of the
common errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-
ing due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-
iment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and
improving the strategy.
In this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can
be used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for
backtesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a
backtest should provide, common pitfalls to avoid, and simple re-
ﬁnements and improvements to strategies. A few fully developed
backtesting examples will also be presented to illustrate the prin-
ciples and techniques described.

After you have built your automated trading system, it is a good idea
to test it in a paper trading account, if your brokerage provides one.
Paper trading has a number of beneﬁts; chief among them is that
this is practically the only way to see if your ATS software has bugs
without losing a lot of real money.
Often, the moment you start paper trading you will realize that
there is a glaring look-ahead bias in your strategy—there may just be
no way you could have obtained some crucial piece of data before
you enter an order! If this happens, it is “back to the drawing board.”
You should be able run your ATS, execute paper trades, and then
compare the paper trades and proﬁt and loss (P&L) with the theoret-
ical ones generated by your backtest program using the latest data.
If the difference is not due to transaction costs (including an ex-
pected delay in execution for the paper trades), then your software
likely has bugs. (I mentioned the names of some of the brokerages
that offer paper trading accounts in Chapter 4.)
Another beneﬁt of paper trading is that it gives you better in-
tuitive understanding of your strategy, including the volatility of its
P&L, the typical amount of capital utilized, the number of trades per
day, and the various operational difﬁculties including data issues.
Even though you can theoretically check out most of these features
of your strategy in a backtest, one will usually gain intuition only if
one faces them on a daily, ongoing basis. Backtesting also won’t re-
veal the operational difﬁculties, such as how fast you can download
all the needed data before the market opens each day and how you
can optimize your operational procedures in actual execution.
(Do not underestimate the time required for preparing your or-
ders before the market opens. It took me some 20 minutes to down-
load and parse all my historical data each morning, and it took an-
other 15 minutes or so to transmit all the orders to my account. If
your trading strategy depends on data or news prior to the market
open that cannot be more than 35 minutes old, then you need to
either ﬁgure out a different execution environment or modify your

A
t this point, you should have backtested a good strategy
(maybe something like the pair-trading strategy in Example
3.6), picked a brokerage (e.g., Interactive Brokers), and have
set up a good operating environment (at ﬁrst, nothing more than a
computer, a high-speed Internet connection, and a real-time news-
feed). You are almost ready to execute your trading strategy—after
you have implemented an automated trading system (ATS) to gener-
ate and transmit your orders to your brokerage for execution. This
chapter is about building such an automated trading system and
ways to minimize trading costs and divergence with your expected
performance based on your backtests.

performance of the strategy from its backtest performance. Issues
discussed here include:
r Data: Split/dividend adjustments, noise in daily high/low, and
survivorship bias.
r Performance measurement: Annualized Sharpe ratio and maxi-
mum drawdown.
r Look-ahead bias: Using unobtainable future information for past
trading decisions.
r Data-snooping bias: Using too many parameters to ﬁt historical
data, and avoiding it using large enough sample, out-of-sample
testing, and sensitivity analysis.
r Transaction cost: Impact of transaction costs on performance.
r Strategy reﬁnement: Common ways to make small variations on
the strategy to optimize performance.
After going through this chapter and working through some of
the examples and exercises, you should have gained some hands-on
experience in how to retrieve historical data and backtest a strategy
with either Excel or MATLAB.
When one starts testing a strategy, it may not be possible to
avoid all these pitfalls due to constraints of time and other re-
sources. In this case, it is okay to skip a few precautions to achieve
a quick sense of whether the strategy has potential and is worthy of
closer examination. Sometimes, even the most thorough and careful
backtest cannot reveal problems that would be obvious after a few
months of paper or real trading. One can always revisit each of these
issues after the model has gone live.
Once you have backtested a strategy with reasonable perfor-
mance, you are now ready to take the next step in setting up your
trading business.

TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) is familiar to many retail
traders as a brokerage that provides all-in-one backtesting and trade
execution platforms linked to the brokerage’s servers. The main ad-
vantages of this setup are:
r Most of the historical data necessary for backtesting is readily
available, whereas you have to download the data from some-
where else if you use Excel or MATLAB.
r Once you have backtested the program, you can immediately
generate orders using the same program and transmit them to
the brokerage.
The disadvantages of this approach are that once you have writ-
ten the software for your strategy, you are tied to TradeStation as
your broker, and the proprietary language used by TradeStation is
not as ﬂexible as MATLAB and does not include some of the more
advanced statistical and mathematical functions some traders use.
Nevertheless, if you prefer the ease of use of an all-in-one system,
TradeStation may be a good choice.
Since I have not used TradeStation in my own work, I will not
include backtesting examples in TradeStation.

The ultimate out-of-sample testing is familiar to many traders,
and it is called paper trading. Running the model on actual unseen
data is the most reliable way to test it (short of actually trading it).
Paper trading not only allows you to perform a truly honest out-
of-sample test; it often allows you to discover look-ahead errors in
your programs, as well as making you aware of various operational
issues. I will discuss paper trading in Chapter 5.
If the strategy that you are testing comes from a published
source, and you are just conducting a backtest to verify that the re-
sults are correct, then the entire period between the time of publi-
cation and the time that you tested the strategy is a genuine out-of-
sample period. As long as you do not optimize the parameters of the
published model on the out-of-sample period, this period is as good
as paper trading the strategy.

MATLAB R⃝(www.mathworks.com) is one of the most common
backtesting platforms used by quantitative analysts and traders in
large institutions. It is ideal for testing strategies that involve a
large portfolio of stocks. (Imagine backtesting a strategy involving
1,500 symbols on Excel—it is possible, but quite painful.). It has nu-
merous advanced statistical and mathematical modules built in, so
traders do not have to reinvent the wheel if their trading algorithms
involve some sophisticated but common mathematical concepts.

the test set). (The two portions should be roughly equal in size, but if
there is insufﬁcient training data, we should at least have one-third
as much test data as training data. The minimum size of the training
set is determined by the rule of thumb in the previous section.) Ide-
ally, the set of optimal parameters and decisions for the ﬁrst part of
the backtest period is also the optimal set for the second period, but
things are rarely this perfect. The performance on the second part
of the data should at least be reasonable. Otherwise, the model has
data-snooping bias built into it, and one way to cure it is to simplify
the model and eliminate some parameters.
A more rigorous (albeit more computationally intensive)
method of out-of-sample testing is to use moving optimization of
the parameters. In this case, the parameters themselves are con-
stantly adapting to the changing historical data, and data-snooping
bias with respect to parameters is eliminated. (See the sidebar on
parameterless trading models.)

In a semiautomated trading system (shown in Figure 5.1), a user
typically generates a list of orders using familiar and easy-to-use
software such as Excel or MATLAB. Often, the program that gen-
erates this order list is the same as the backtest program: After all,
you are implementing the same quantitative strategy that you have
backtested. Of course, you must remember to update the input data
ﬁle to reﬂect the most recent data. This is usually done with either
a MATLAB program that can directly go to a web site to retrieve
the appropriate data, or with a separate program such as HQuote,
mentioned earlier, which can download en masse historical price
data for a large number of symbols. In the latter case, MATLAB is
used only to organize those data in a suitable format for the trading
strategy program that generates today’s orders.
The data update step is easy when the most recent data is the

Building a Semiautomated Trading System
In a semiautomated trading system (shown in Figure 5.1), a user
typically generates a list of orders using familiar and easy-to-use
software such as Excel or MATLAB. Often, the program that gen-
erates this order list is the same as the backtest program: After all,

generated a large amount of commissions in the previous trading
month, Interactive Brokers allows you to update only 100 sym-
bols by default.) Similarly, order submissions through DDE links
are also slow. Hence, for trading strategies that react to real-time
market data changes intraday, this setup using a spreadsheet is not
feasible.
There are some brokerages such as TradeStation that offer a
complete backtesting and order submission platform. If you back-
tested on such a platform, then it is trivial to conﬁgure it so that
the program will submit real orders to your account. This dispenses
with the need to write your own software, whether for backtesting
or for automated execution. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 3,
the drawback of such proprietary systems is that they are seldom as
ﬂexible as a general-purpose programming language like MATLAB
or Java for the construction of your strategy. For instance, if you
want to pursue a rather mathematically complex strategy based on
principal component analysis (such as the one in Example 7.4), it
would be quite difﬁcult to backtest in TradeStation. More advanced
integrated trading platforms such as Alphacet’s Discovery do

this is practically the only way to see if your ATS software has bugs

52 QUANTITATIVE TRADING
It is best to do a ﬁnal checkup of your MATLAB backtest program
using this method: Run the program using all your historical data;
generate and save the resulting position ﬁle to ﬁle A (position ﬁle
is the ﬁle that contains all the recommended positions generated
by the program on each day). Now truncate your historical data so
that the most recent portion (sayN days) is removed. So if the last
day in the original data isT, then the last day in the truncated data
should beT-N. N could be 10 days to 100 days. Now run the back-
test program again using the truncated data and save the resulting
positions into a new ﬁle B. Truncate the most recentN rows of the
positions ﬁle A so that both A and B have the same number of rows
(days) in them, and the last day in both ﬁle A and B should beT-N.
Finally, check if A and B are identical in their positions. If not, you
have a look-ahead bias in your backtest program that you must ﬁnd
and correct, because the discrepancies in positions mean that you
are inadvertently using the truncated part of the historical data (the
part that lies ahead of dayT-N) in determining the positions in ﬁle
A. I will illustrate this somewhat convoluted procedure at the end of
Example 3.6.

issues after the model has gone live.

for each historical bar. As a result, I personally have seldom traded parameter-
less models, until I get to research my regime-switching model described in
Example 7.1. That model is almost parameterless (I left out a few parameters
from optimization because of a lack of time, not because of any technical dif-
ﬁculties). How was I able to perform backtest parameter optimization within a
few minutes in this case? I got to use a high-end backtesting platform (Alphacet
Discovery).

The ultimate out-of-sample testing is familiar to many traders,
and it is calledpaper trading.Running the model on actual unseen
data is the most reliable way to test it (short of actually trading it).
Paper trading not only allows you to perform a truly honest out-
of-sample test; it often allows you to discover look-ahead errors in
your programs, as well as making you aware of various operational
issues. I will discuss paper trading in Chapter 5.
If the strategy that you are testing comes from a published
source, and you are just conducting a backtest to verify that the re-
sults are correct, then the entire period between the time of publi-
cation and the time that you tested the strategy is a genuine out-of-

est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The
worst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a
slow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-
tic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple
accounts.
Though successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-
ous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the
average holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.
Transaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such
strategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-
gies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just
having high-frequency data with last prices is not sufﬁcient—data
with bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to ﬁnd out the proﬁtability
of executing on the bid versus the ask. Sometimes, we may even
need historical order book information for backtesting. Quite often,
the only true test for such strategies is to run it in real-time unless
one has an extremely sophisticated simulator.

common errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-
ing due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-
iment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and
improving the strategy.
In this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can
be used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for
backtesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a

COMMON BACKTESTING PITFALLS
TO AVOID
Backtesting is the process of creating the historical trades given the
historical information available at that time, and then ﬁnding out
what the subsequent performance of those trades is. This process
seems easy given that the trades were made using a computer algo-
rithm in our case, but there are numerous ways in which it can go
wrong. Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical

tested on such a platform, then it is trivial to conﬁgure it so that
the program will submit real orders to your account. This dispenses
with the need to write your own software, whether for backtesting
or for automated execution. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 3,
the drawback of such proprietary systems is that they are seldom as
ﬂexible as a general-purpose programming language like MATLAB

rigorously backtest them? If the backtest performance is good, what
steps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both
the business structure and the technological infrastructure? If the
strategy is proﬁtable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale

Forex trading strategies can be developed by following popular trading styles which are day trad­
ing, carry trade, buy and hold strategy, hedging, portfolio trading, spread trading, swing trading, 
order trading and algorithmic trading.
Using and developing trading strategies mostly depends on understanding your strengths and 
weaknesses.In order to be successful in trade you should find the best way of trading that suits your 
personality.There is no fixed “right” way of trading; the right way for others may not work for you. 
Below you can read about each trading style and define your own.

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat­
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com­
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa­
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actually not the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as
historical fundamental data). Furthermore, many of these academic

T
he ﬁrst six chapters of this book covered most of the ba-
sic knowledge needed to research, develop, and execute your
own quantitative strategy. This chapter explains important
themes in quantitative trading in more detail. These themes form the
bases of statistical arbitrage trading, and most quantitative traders
are conversant in some if not most of these topics. They are also
very helpful in informing our intuition about trading.
I will describe the two basic categories of trading strategies:
mean-reverting versus momentum strategies. Periods of mean-
reverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders
call regimes, and the switch between different regimes is a topic of
discussion here. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathemati-
cal justiﬁcation from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration
of time series, which I will cover next. Then I will describe a the-
ory that many hedge funds use to manage large portfolios and one
that has caused much turmoil in their performances: namely, factor
models. Other categories of strategies that traders frequently dis-
cuss are seasonal trading and high-frequency strategies. All trading
strategies require a way to exit their positions; I will describe the dif-
ferent logical ways to do this. Finally, I ponder the question of how
to best enhance the returns of a strategy: through higher leverage or
trading higher-beta stocks?

proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.
The book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that
traders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-
ness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-
ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing
the money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this
strategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of
important advanced concepts with which most professional quan-
titative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with
reﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how
they can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that
contains a tutorial on using MATLAB.

Order trading helps traders to enter or exit a position at the most suitable moment by using differ­
ent orders including market orders, pending orders, limit orders, stop orders, stop loss orders and 
OCO orders.
Currently, advanced trading platforms provide various types of orders in trading which are not 
simply ‘’buy button’’ and ‘’sell button’’. Each type of trading order can represent a specific strategy.  
It’s important to know when and how to trade and which order to use in a given situation in order to 
develop the right order strategy.

Does the Strategy “Fly under the Radar”
of Institutional Money Managers?
Since this book is about starting a quantitative trading business from
scratch, and not about starting a hedge fund that manages multiple
millions of dollars, we should not be concerned whether a strategy
is one that can absorb multiple millions of dollars. (Capacity is the
technical term for how much a strategy can absorb without nega-
tively impacting its returns.) In fact, quite the opposite—you should
look for those strategies that ﬂy under the radar of most institutional
investors, for example, strategies that have very low capacities be-
cause they trade too often, strategies that trade very few stocks ev-
ery day, or strategies that have very infrequent positions (such as
some seasonal trades in commodity futures described in Chapter 7).
Those niches are the ones that are likely still to be proﬁtable because
they have not yet been completely arbitraged away by the gigantic
hedge funds.

higher level than longer-term strategies can, and this high leverage
in turn boosts the return-on-equity of the strategy to often strato-
spheric levels.
Of course, the law of large numbers does not explain why a
particular high-frequency strategy has positive mean return in the
ﬁrst place. In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-
frequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such
strategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-
verting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral
pair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-
eral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in
the market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.
Unlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals
where the market environment can experience upheavals during the
lifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist
day to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The
worst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a
slow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-
tic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple
accounts.

ous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the
average holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.

gies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just

Range trading strategy, which is also called channel trading, is generally associated with the lack 
of market direction and it is used during the absence of a trend. Range trading identifies currency 
price movement in channels and the first task of this strategy is to find the range. This process can 
be carried out by connecting a series of highs and lows with a horizontal trendline. In other words, 
the trader should find the major support and resistance levels with the area in between known as 
“trading range”.

higher level than longer-term strategies can, and this high leverage
in turn boosts the return-on-equity of the strategy to often strato-
spheric levels.
Of course, the law of large numbers does not explain why a
particular high-frequency strategy has positive mean return in the
ﬁrst place. In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-
frequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such
strategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-
verting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral
pair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-
eral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in
the market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.
Unlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals
where the market environment can experience upheavals during the
lifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist
day to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The

Forex Strategies Based on Trading Style
   Portfolio trading, which can also be called basket trading, is based on the combination of different 
assets belonging to different financial markets (Forex, stock, futures, etc.).
   The concept behind portfolio trading is diversification, one of the most popular means of risk re -
duction. By a smart asset allocation traders protect themselves from market volatility, reduce the risk 
extent and keep the profit balance.
   It’s very important to create a diversified portfolio to reach your trading goal. Otherwise, this kind 
of strategy will be aimless.
   Currently IFC Markets offers a new method, called GeWorko Method, which makes it even much 
easier for you to perform portfolio trading. The method provides numerous opportunities for traders 
to take the highest profit from trade. By Geworko Method you can create portfolios starting from 
only two assets up to hundreds of different financial instruments, open both long and short positions 
within a portfolio, view the assets’ price history stretching up to 40 years, create your own PCIs, use 
a wide variety of market analysis tools, apply different trading strategies and constantly optimize and 
rebalance your portfolio. In other words, GeWorko Method seems the integrity of all trading opportu-
nities and strategies, through which you can organize your trade in the way you desire, develop the

CHAPTER 7
Special Topics in
Quantitative
Trading
T
he ﬁrst six chapters of this book covered most of the ba-
sic knowledge needed to research, develop, and execute your
own quantitative strategy. This chapter explains important
themes in quantitative trading in more detail. These themes form the
bases of statistical arbitrage trading, and most quantitative traders
are conversant in some if not most of these topics. They are also
very helpful in informing our intuition about trading.
I will describe the two basic categories of trading strategies:
mean-reverting versus momentum strategies. Periods of mean-
reverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders
callregimes, and the switch between different regimes is a topic of
discussion here. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathemati-
cal justiﬁcation from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration
of time series, which I will cover next. Then I will describe a the-
ory that many hedge funds use to manage large portfolios and one
that has caused much turmoil in their performances: namely, factor
models. Other categories of strategies that traders frequently dis-
cuss are seasonal trading and high-frequency strategies. All trading
strategies require a way to exit their positions; I will describe the dif-
ferent logical ways to do this. Finally, I ponder the question of how

Order trading helps traders to enter or exit a position at the most suitable moment by using differ-
ent orders including market orders, pending orders, limit orders, stop orders, stop loss orders and 
OCO orders.
   Currently, advanced trading platforms provide various types of orders in trading which are not 
simply ‘’buy button’’ and ‘’sell button’’. Each type of trading order can represent a specific strategy.    
It’s important to know when and how to trade and which order to use in a given situation in order to 
develop the right order strategy.
   The most popular Forex orders that a trader can apply in his trade are:
   Market orders - a market order is placed to instruct the trader to buy or to sell at the best price 
available. The entry interfaces of market order usually have only ‘’buy’’ and ‘’sell’’ options which 
make it quick and easy to use.
   Pending Orders – pending orders which are usually available in six types allow traders to buy or 
sell securities at a previously specified price. The pending orders-buy limit, sell limit, buy stop, sell 
stop, buy stop limit and sell stop limit- are placed to execute a trade once the price reaches the 
specified level.
   Limit Orders- a limit order instructs the trader to buy or sell the asset at a specified price. This 
means that first of all the trader should specify the desired buy and sell prices. The buy limit order

trade on my own, I worried that I would be cut off from the ﬂow
of trading ideas from my colleagues and mentors. But then I found
out that one of the best ways to gather and share trading ideas is
to start your own trading blog—for every trading “secret” that you
divulge to the world, you will be rewarded with multiple ones from
your readers. (The person who suggested the Wealth-Lab strategy to
me was a reader who works 12 time zones away. If it weren’t for my
blog, there was little chance that I would have met him and bene-
ﬁted from his suggestion.) In fact, what you thought of as secrets
are more often than not well-known ideas to many others! What
truly make a strategy proprietary and its secrets worth protecting
are the tricks and variations that you have come up with, not the
plain vanilla version.
Furthermore, your bad ideas will quickly get shot down by your
online commentators, thus potentially saving you from major losses.
After I glowingly described a seasonal stock-trading strategy on
my blog that was developed by some ﬁnance professors, a reader
promptly went ahead and backtested that strategy and reported that
it didn’t work. (See my blog entry, “Seasonal Trades in Stocks,”
at epchan.blogspot.com/2007/11/seasonal-trades-in-stocks.html and

proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.
The book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that
traders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-
ness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-
ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing

look for those strategies that ﬂy under the radar of most institutional
investors, for example, strategies that have very low capacities be-
cause they trade too often, strategies that trade very few stocks ev-
ery day, or strategies that have very infrequent positions (such as
some seasonal trades in commodity futures described in Chapter 7).
Those niches are the ones that are likely still to be proﬁtable because
they have not yet been completely arbitraged away by the gigantic
hedge funds.

Carry trade is a strategy through which a trader borrows a currency in a low interest country, 
converts it into a currency in a high interest rate country and invests it in high grade debt secu-

Technical indicators are calculations which are based on the price and volume of a security. They 
are used both to confirm the trend and the quality of chart patterns, and to help traders determine the 
buy and sell signals.The indicators can be applied separately to form buy and sell signals, as well as 
can be used together, in conjunction with chart patterns and price movement.
Technical analysis indicators can form buy and sell signals through crossovers and divergence. 
Crossovers are reflected when price moves through the moving average or when two different 
moving averages cross each other. Divergence happens when the price trend and the indicator 
trend move in opposite directions indicating that the direction of price trend is weakening.

• Simplicity: The Supertrend indicator boasts a straightforward calculation, making it readily interpretable for
traders of all experience levels [Sahoo et al., 2017].
• Trend Identification: It’s dynamic nature allows for effective identification of both uptrends (price consistently
above the Supertrend line) and downtrends (price consistently below the Supertrend line) [Bhuiyan et al.,
2016].
• Reduced False Signals: Compared to some other trend-following indicators, the Supertrend may generate
fewer false signals due to its incorporation of the ATR, which helps account for volatility .

Forex technical analysis is the study of market action primarily through the use of charts for the 
purpose of forecasting future price trends. Forex traders can develop strategies based on various 
technical analysis tools including market trend, volume, range,support and resistance levels, chart 
patterns and indicators, as well as conduct a Multiple Time Frame Analysis using different time-
frame charts.
Technical analysis strategy is a crucial method of evaluating assets based on the analysis and 
statistics of past market action, such as past prices and past volume. The main goal of technical 
analysts is not the measuring of asset’s underlying value, they attempt to use charts or other tools 
of technical analysis to determine patterns that will help to forecast future market activity. Their firm 
belief is that the future performance of markets can be indicated by the historical performance.

• Lagging Indicator: The Supertrend indicator, like most technical indicators, is inherently backward-looking,
relying on past price data to generate signals. This can lead to delayed entry and exit points, particularly during
volatile market environments [Sahoo et al., 2017]
• Whipsaws: During periods of increased market volatility, the Supertrend indicator may generate whipsaws,
where the price oscillates above and below the Supertrend line, leading to unnecessary trades and potential
losses.
• Parameter Sensitivity: The Supertrend indicator’s performance is heavily influenced by the chosen atr multiplier
and atr period. Finding the optimal settings can be challenging and may require experimentation or optimization
techniques [Bhuiyan et al., 2016].

While technical analysis is focused on the study and past performance of market action, Forex 
fundamental analysis concentrates on the fundamental reasons that make an impact on the market 
direction.
The premise of Forex fundamental analysis is that macroeconomic indicators like economic growth 
rates, interest and unemployment rates, inflation, or important political issues can have an impact on 
financial markets and, therefore, can be used for making trading decisions.
Technicians do not find it necessary to know the reasons of market changes, but fundamen­
talists try to discover “why”. The latter analyze macroeconomic data of a specific country or 
different countries to forecast the given country’s currency behaviour in the nearest future. 
Based on certain events or calculations, they may decide to buy the currency in the hope that 
the latter will rise in value and they will be able to sell it at a higher price, or they will sell the 
currency to buy it later at a lower price.
The reason why fundamental analysts use so long timeframe is the following: the data they study 
are generated much more slowly than the price and volume data used by technical analysts.

The financial markets, with their intricate dynamics and perpetual evolution, have long captivated scholars and
practitioners alike. While the quest for a foolproof prediction method remains an elusive ideal, technical analysis offers
a valuable toolkit for navigating market trends and identifying potential entry and exit points for investment strategies.
Within this realm, the Supertrend indicator has emerged as a popular choice for its simplicity and effectiveness in
capturing prevailing market directions.
arXiv:2405.14262v1  [q-fin.TR]  23 May 2024
The Supertrend indicator, built upon the foundation of the Average True Range (ATR), provides visual cues regarding
the dominant market trend. It constructs a dynamic line, incorporating a user-defined multiplier, that adapts to market
volatility. When the price action consistently pushes above the Supertrend line, it suggests a potential uptrend, prompting
the adoption of long positions. Conversely, a price consistently trading below the line signals a possible downtrend,
favoring short positions.
Despite its apparent utility, the efficacy of the Supertrend indicator hinges on two crucial parameters: the atr_multiplier
and the atr_period. The atr_multiplier dictates the sensitivity of the Supertrend line to price fluctuations. A higher
multiplier leads to a steeper line, potentially generating fewer but potentially larger signals, while a lower multiplier
creates a smoother line with potentially more frequent but smaller signals. The atr_period, on the other hand, influences
the responsiveness of the Supertrend line to recent price movements. A shorter period captures recent trends quicker but
might be more susceptible to volatility, while a longer period provides a more smoothed-out trend but might lag behind
rapid price changes.
Striking an optimal balance between these parameters is critical for maximizing a strategy’s effectiveness. However,
manually testing every possible combination is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, especially as the number
of parameters increases. This is where Bayesian optimization (BO) enters the scene as a powerful and sophisticated
optimization technique.

Technical indicators are statistics of the market that quan-

veloped by professional traders using trial and error. It is
common practice to use rules based on technical indicators
to choose the timing of buy and sell orders. These rules
are called buy and sell “signals”. In this work we use a
combination of market indicators and trading signals. We

itable technique and support the efﬁcient market hypothe-
sis. Part of the problem of the studies during the 60s was
the ad hoc speciﬁcations of the trading rules that led to data
snooping. Ex post speciﬁcation of rules may have led to
biased studies. Recently, Allen and Karjalainen [3] found
proﬁtable trading rules using genetic algorithm for the S&P
500 with daily prices from 1928 to 1995. However, these
rules were not consistently better than a buy-and-hold strat-
egy in the out-of-sample test periods.
In the last years, there has been a growing interest
on applying machine learning methods to formulate trad-
ing strategies using technical indicators such as the follow-
ing: Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang [53], who used nonparamet-
ric kernel regression for technical pattern recognition of a
large number of stocks for the period 1962 - 1996, found
that technical indicators provide incremental information
for investors comparing the unconditional empirical distri-
bution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution
on speciﬁc technical indicators such as head and shoulders.
Moody and Saffell [54] found that a trading system us-
ing direct reinforcement learning outperforms a Q-trader
for the asset allocation problem between the S&P 500 and
T-bill. Dempster et al. [25] compared four methods for
foreign exchange trading (reinforcement learning, genetic
algorithm, Markov chain linear programming, and simple
heuristic) and concluded that a combination of technical

deﬁne these indicators in this appendix and provide the ba-
sic intuition that motivates them. Throughout this section
we assume a single ﬁxed stock.
We start with some basic mathematical notation. We
index the trading days by t = 1,2,... . We denote by
Po
t,Pc
t,Puc
t ,Ph
t, and Pl
t, the open, adjusted close, unad-
justed close11, high, and low price of the tth trading day.
We eliminate the lower index when we wish to refer to
the whole sequence, i.e. Pc refers to the whole sequence
Pc
1,Pc
2,... .
Many of the technical indicators incorporate time av-
erages of prices or of other indicators. We use two types
of time averages, the simple moving average and the ex-
ponentially weighted moving average. 12 Let X denote a
time sequence X1,X2,... . The simple moving averageis
deﬁned as
SMAt(X,n) = 1
n
n−1∑
s=0
Xt−s ,
and the exponentially weighted moving averageis de-
ﬁned as
EMAt(X,n) =λ
∞∑
s=0
(1 −λ)sXt−s; λ= 2
n+ 1.
A useful property of EMAt(X,n) is that it can be calcu-
lated using a simple update rule:
EMAt(X,n) =λXt + (1−λ)EMAt−1(X,n) .
We name as “rule” and follow by an identiﬁcation
number the most common rules associated with each indi-
cator. Most of the buy and sell signals are generated when
the value of an indicator crosses some threshold or the
value of another indicator. The input to our learning sys-
tem includes both signals and indicators. We use normal-
ized indicators, by which we mean indicators whose value

Trading Strategies Based on Forex Analysis
   Technical indicators are calculations which are based on the price and volume of a security. They 
are used both to confirm the trend and the quality of chart patterns, and to help traders determine the 
buy and sell signals.The indicators can be applied separately to form buy and sell signals, as well as 
can be used together, in conjunction with chart patterns and price movement.
   They can be applied separately to form buy and sell signals, as well as can be used together, in 
conjunction with the market. However, not all of them are used widely by traders. The following in -
dicators mentioned below are of utmost importance for analysts and at least one of them is used by 
each trader to develop his trading strategy:
  
   Moving Average
   Bollinger Bands
   Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   Stochastic Oscillator
   Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
   RSI-Bars
   ADX
   Momentum
   You can easily learn how to use each indicator and develop trading strategies by indicators.
Technical analysis indicators can form buy and sell signals through crossovers and divergence. 
Crossovers are reflected when price moves through the moving average or when two different 
moving averages cross each other. Divergence happens when the price trend and the indicator 
trend move in opposite directions indicating that the direction of price trend is weakening.

cator. Most of the buy and sell signals are generated when
the value of an indicator crosses some threshold or the
value of another indicator. The input to our learning sys-
tem includes both signals and indicators. We use normal-
ized indicators, by which we mean indicators whose value
does not change if all the prices in the sequence are multi-
plied by a constant factor. This is important when working
with adjusted stock prices.
Additionally, we recalculate a selected group of indi-
cators and their rules with three different values of the main
parameters that are close to the industry practice. So, our
learning system should be able to select the optimal com-
bination of indicators and parameters. Additionally, we in-
clude ratios of the indicators which generally are calculated
as the indicator divided by its moving average. Most of
these ratios are part of the trading rules. However, we in-
clude the ratios by themselves so that our learning system
ﬁnds its own rules. Finally, there are indicators that do not

indicators. Additional useful references about technical analysis and trad-
ing are [44, 55, 16, 59, 60, 26, 18].

Forex technical analysis is the study of market action primarily through the use of charts for the 
purpose of forecasting future price trends. Forex traders can develop strategies based on various 
technical analysis tools including market trend, volume, range,support and resistance levels, chart 
patterns and indicators, as well as conduct a Multiple Time Frame Analysis using different time-
frame charts.
   Technical analysis strategy is a crucial method of evaluating assets based on the analysis and 
statistics of past market action, such as past prices and past volume. The main goal of technical 
analysts is not the measuring of asset’s underlying value, they attempt to use charts or other tools 
of technical analysis to determine patterns that will help to forecast future market activity. Their firm 
belief is that the future performance of markets can be indicated by the historical performance.

ment theories or statistical assumptions. Our algorithm also
combines different recommendations of experts or “artiﬁ-
cial” fund managers. However, the deﬁnition of experts
and their combination is completely different of how it is
done in CUP. Our algorithm is based on a learning algo-
rithm and has an online learning capacity that assigns dif-
ferent weights according to the performance of its experts.
As a result, the portfolio is reallocated based on the risk ad-
justed return of its underlying assets, and the combination
of experts’ forecasts.
1.2 Trading strategies and technical analysis
Another important line of research in the trading algorith-
mic literature is the use of learning algorithms to generate
trading rules using technical analysis indicators. Technical
analysis or technical trading strategies try to exploit statis-
tically measurable short-term market opportunities, such as
trend spotting, and momentum, in individual industrial sec-
tors (e.g. ﬁnancial, pharmaceutical etc.).
The presence of technical analysis has been very lim-
ited in the ﬁnance literature because of its lack of a solid
statistical or mathematical foundation, its highly subjec-
tive nature, and its visual nature. In the 60s and 70s re-
searchers studied trading rules based on technical indica-
tors and did not ﬁnd them proﬁtable [1] [31]. These ﬁnd-
ings led Fama [30] to dismiss technical analysis as a prof-
itable technique and support the efﬁcient market hypothe-

• High and low: These are the highest and lowest prices of the asset during a specified time frame.
2.1.2 Advantages
• Simplicity: The Supertrend indicator boasts a straightforward calculation, making it readily interpretable for
traders of all experience levels [Sahoo et al., 2017].
• Trend Identification: It’s dynamic nature allows for effective identification of both uptrends (price consistently
above the Supertrend line) and downtrends (price consistently below the Supertrend line) [Bhuiyan et al.,
2016].
• Reduced False Signals: Compared to some other trend-following indicators, the Supertrend may generate
fewer false signals due to its incorporation of the ATR, which helps account for volatility .
2.1.3 Limitations:
• Lagging Indicator: The Supertrend indicator, like most technical indicators, is inherently backward-looking,
relying on past price data to generate signals. This can lead to delayed entry and exit points, particularly during
volatile market environments [Sahoo et al., 2017]
• Whipsaws: During periods of increased market volatility, the Supertrend indicator may generate whipsaws,
where the price oscillates above and below the Supertrend line, leading to unnecessary trades and potential
losses.
• Parameter Sensitivity: The Supertrend indicator’s performance is heavily influenced by the chosen atr multiplier
and atr period. Finding the optimal settings can be challenging and may require experimentation or optimization
techniques [Bhuiyan et al., 2016].

This book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-
tive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about
speciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-
ample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-
stead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy
yourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how
to reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical
performance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain

Example of the use of this methodology
I report the following practical example; the figure shows the trend of a hypothetical stock. The 
value of this stock on a thousand time intervals rises one unit 60% of the time and goes down by one 
unit 40% of the time. In order to simplify the calculations the price movement is unitary. Now let us 
look at two strategies that execute 500 trades, each trade lasts an interval of time. The first strategy 
execute only buys  and in order to choose when to buy, flips a coin, if it win opens a trades if loses 
it waits for the next unit of time and repeats the operation. The second strategy, on the other hand, 
is a strategy that sells only, but does not do it in a random way, it uses information that allows it a 
10% advantage in determining the drops of the value stock.
The first strategy gets a profit of 100 by winning 60% of trades. Now we calculate the probability 
of obtaining a better result in a random way, to do this we use the binomial cumulative distribution 
function with the following parameters:
p = 60% (probability of win)

By using the binomial distribution formula, given a value of L, we can obtain the probability 
of achieving better results with the random strategy described above. The results for the L values 
ranging from 10 to 200 are shown in Figure 1. Looking at the figure, we see how the probability 
tends asymptotically toward 50%. Therefore, we have a 50% chance of getting better or worse 
results. Basically, the strategy described in the paradox tends asymptotically toward a random 
strategy. Consequently, the doubling-down strategy turns out to be a strategy that does not 
implement useful information for improving our likelihood of victory. Thus, using the cognitive 
aspect as a method of evaluation has proven the irrationality of the strategy.
We use very similar approaches, where the strategy being evaluated is compared with an 
equivalent random strategy, in the financial field to analyse the results generated by a trading

A
ll trading strategies suffer occasional losses, technically
known as drawdowns. The drawdowns may last a few min-
utes or a few years. To proﬁt from a quantitative trading busi-
ness, it is essential to manage your risks in a way that limits your
drawdowns to a tolerable level and yet be positioned to use opti-
mal leverage of your equity to achieve maximum possible growth of
your wealth. Furthermore, if you have more than one strategy, you
will also need to ﬁnd a way to optimally allocate capital among them
so as to maximize overall risk-adjusted return.
The optimal allocation of capital and the optimal leverage to use
so as to strike the right balance between risk management and max-
imum growth is the focus of this chapter, and the central tool we
use is called the Kelly formula.

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat­
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com­
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa­
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

higher level than longer-term strategies can, and this high leverage
in turn boosts the return-on-equity of the strategy to often strato-
spheric levels.
Of course, the law of large numbers does not explain why a
particular high-frequency strategy has positive mean return in the
ﬁrst place. In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-
frequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such
strategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-
verting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral
pair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-
eral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in
the market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.
Unlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals
where the market environment can experience upheavals during the
lifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist
day to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The
worst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a
slow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-
tic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple
accounts.
Though successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-
ous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the
average holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.
Transaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such
strategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-
gies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just
having high-frequency data with last prices is not sufﬁcient—data
with bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to ﬁnd out the proﬁtability
of executing on the bid versus the ask. Sometimes, we may even
need historical order book information for backtesting. Quite often,
the only true test for such strategies is to run it in real-time unless
one has an extremely sophisticated simulator.

r Estimation of the optimal holding period of a momentum strat-
egy can be error prone due to the small number of signals.
r Stop loss can be suitable for momentum strategies but not re-
versal strategies.
r Seasonal trading strategies for stocks (i.e., calendar effect) have
become unproﬁtable in recent years.
r Seasonal trading strategies for commodity futures continue to
be proﬁtable.
r High-frequency trading strategies rely on the “law of large num-
bers” for their high Sharpe ratios.
r High-frequency trading strategies typically generate the highest
long-term compounded growth due to their high Sharpe ratios.
r High-frequency trading strategies are very difﬁcult to backtest
and very technology reliant for their execution.
r Holding a highly leveraged portfolio of low-beta stocks should
generate higher long-term compounded growth than holding un-
leveraged portfolio of high-beta stocks.
Most statistical arbitrage trading strategies are some combina-
tion of these effects or models: Whether they are proﬁtable or not
is more of an issue of where and when to apply them than whether
they are theoretically correct or not.

he ﬁrst six chapters of this book covered most of the ba-
sic knowledge needed to research, develop, and execute your
own quantitative strategy. This chapter explains important
themes in quantitative trading in more detail. These themes form the
bases of statistical arbitrage trading, and most quantitative traders
are conversant in some if not most of these topics. They are also
very helpful in informing our intuition about trading.
I will describe the two basic categories of trading strategies:
mean-reverting versus momentum strategies. Periods of mean-
reverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders
call regimes, and the switch between different regimes is a topic of
discussion here. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathemati-
cal justiﬁcation from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration
of time series, which I will cover next. Then I will describe a the-
ory that many hedge funds use to manage large portfolios and one
that has caused much turmoil in their performances: namely, factor
models. Other categories of strategies that traders frequently dis-
cuss are seasonal trading and high-frequency strategies. All trading
strategies require a way to exit their positions; I will describe the dif-
ferent logical ways to do this. Finally, I ponder the question of how
to best enhance the returns of a strategy: through higher leverage or
trading higher-beta stocks?

his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actually not the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as
historical fundamental data). Furthermore, many of these academic

20 QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Now that you know what a Sharpe ratio is, you may want to
ﬁnd out what kind of Sharpe ratio your candidate strategies have.
Often, they are not reported by the authors of that strategy, and you
will have to e-mail them in private for this detail. And often, they
will oblige, especially if the authors are ﬁnance professors; but if
they refuse, you have no choice but to perform the backtest yourself.
Sometimes, however, you can still make an educated guess based on
the ﬂimsiest of information:
r If a strategy trades only a few times a year, chances are its
Sharpe ratio won’t be high. This does not prevent it from being
part of your multistrategy trading business, but it does disqualify
the strategy from being your main proﬁt center.
r If a strategy has deep (e.g., more than 10 percent) or lengthy
(e.g., four or more months) drawdowns, it is unlikely that it will
have a high Sharpe ratio. I will explain the concept of drawdown
in the next section, but you can just visually inspect the equity
curve (which is also the cumulative proﬁt-and-loss curve, assum-
ing no redemption or cash infusion) to see if it is very bumpy
or not. Any peak-to-trough of that curve is a drawdown. (See
Figure 2.1 for an example.)

proﬁts, and therefore it is the levered, compounded growth rate that
is of ultimate importance.)
One approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-
tribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,
with a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should
be net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)
This is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite
inaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with
far higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-
tudes) than Gaussian probability distributions will allow. However,
every scientiﬁc or engineering endeavor starts with the simplest
model with the crudest approximation, and ﬁnance is no excep-
tion. I will discuss the remedies to such inaccuracies later in this
chapter.
Let’s denote the optimal fractions of your equity that you should
allocate to each of yourn strategies by a column vectorF∗ = ( f ∗

Given our optimization objective and the Gaussian assumption,
Dr. Thorp has shown that the optimal allocation is given by

the infamous tipping point? If we do not have a reliable way to es-
timate these time horizons, we cannot execute a momentum trade
proﬁtably based on these phenomena. In a later section on regime
switch, I will examine some attempts to predict these tipping or
“turning” points.
There is one last contrast between mean-reverting and mo-
mentum strategies that is worth pondering. What are the effects
of increasing competition from traders with the same strategies?
For mean-reverting strategies, the effect typically is the gradual
elimination of any arbitrage opportunity, and thus gradually dimin-
ishing returns down to zero. When the number of arbitrage op-
portunities has been reduced to almost zero, the mean-reverting
strategy is subject to the risk that an increasing percentage of
trading signals are actually due to fundamental changes in stocks’
valuation and thus is not going to mean revert. For momentum
strategies, the effect of competition is often the diminishing of the
time horizon over which the trend will continue. As news dissem-
inates at a faster rate and as more traders take advantage of this
trend earlier on, the equilibrium price will be reached sooner. Any

CHAPTER 2
Fishing for Ideas
Where Can We Find
Good Strategies?
T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actuallynot the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as

Wh
ile Dr. Chan takes the time to outline the essential 
aspects of turning quantitative trading strategies 
into proﬁ ts, he doesn’t get into overly theoretical 
or sophisticated theories. Instead, he highlights the 
simple tools and techniques you can use to gain a 
much-needed edge over today’s institutional traders.
And for those who want to keep up with the 
latest news, ideas, and trends in quantitative 
trading, you’re welcome to visit Dr. Chan’s blog, 
epchan.blogspot.com, as well as his premium 
content Web site, epchan.com/subscriptions, 
which you’ll have free access to with purchase of 
this book.
As an independent trader, you’re free from the con-
straints found in today’s institutional environment—
and as long as you adhere to the discipline of 
quantitative trading, you can achieve signiﬁ cant

you’ll quickly discover what it takes to make it in such 
a dynamic and demanding ﬁ eld.

is of ultimate importance.)
One approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-
tribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,
with a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should
be net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)
This is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite
inaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with
far higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-

Using these data, we get a probability to get better results randomly of the 48.3%. 
   Now let us consider the second strategy, this strategy has a total result of zero in practice it 
performs 250 winning trades and 250 losing trades (the 10% advantage allows it to increase the 
probability of victory from 40% to 50%). Also in this case, we calculate the probability of obtaining 
better results randomly, to do this we use the formula of the binomial cumulative distribution

discussed, is not used to make a profit; it rather aims to reduce the risk and uncertainty.

mushrooming computing power, this type of strategies has become
widespread for stock trading as well.
The reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:
Based on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,
the smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will
experience. With high-frequency trading, one can potentially place
hundreds if not thousands of bets all in one day. Therefore, pro-
vided the strategy is sound and generates positive mean return, you
