Forex trading strategies can be developed by following popular trading styles which are day trad­
ing, carry trade, buy and hold strategy, hedging, portfolio trading, spread trading, swing trading, 
order trading and algorithmic trading.
Using and developing trading strategies mostly depends on understanding your strengths and 
weaknesses.In order to be successful in trade you should find the best way of trading that suits your 
personality.There is no fixed “right” way of trading; the right way for others may not work for you.

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat­
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com­
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa­
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.
The book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that
traders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-
ness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-
ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing
the money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this
strategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of
important advanced concepts with which most professional quan-
titative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with
reﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how
they can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that
contains a tutorial on using MATLAB.

Order trading helps traders to enter or exit a position at the most suitable moment by using differ­
ent orders including market orders, pending orders, limit orders, stop orders, stop loss orders and 
OCO orders.
Currently, advanced trading platforms provide various types of orders in trading which are not 
simply ‘’buy button’’ and ‘’sell button’’. Each type of trading order can represent a specific strategy.  
It’s important to know when and how to trade and which order to use in a given situation in order to 
develop the right order strategy.

Are you good at programming? If you know some programming
languages such as Visual Basic or even Java, C#, or C++, you can
explore high-frequency strategies, and you can also trade a large
number of securities. Otherwise, settle for strategies that trade only
once a day, or trade just a few stocks, futures, or currencies. (This

that we had in total.
We aggregated the daily results in 20 test sets (2,000
observations per set equivalent to 20 trading days) that we
used to calculate the performance and risk indicators. The
average of these results are presented in the next section.
We ran the expert weighting algorithm using its three ver-
sions and the following values of the parameter C: 0, 0.05,
0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. When C is 0 is equiv-
alent to apply bagging to Logitboost (bagged boosting) or
to average all the experts. The threshold to eliminate very
weak expert weights (γ0) is set to 0.20, and the threshold
to restrict trading (γ1) is set to 0.
We tested our results with transaction costs of $0,
$0.001, $0.002, and $0.003 per stock. These values are
realistic if we consider that ISLAND has the policy to pay
a rebate of $0.002 per stock to the trader whose order was
in the order books, and charges a rebate of $0.003 per stock
to the trader that submitted the incoming order. Traders can
use this policy in their favour and do not have to pay the full
fee of $0.003. On the contrary, they can capture the rebate
using only limit orders as the market maker strategy sug-
gests. Even more, large brokerage ﬁrms have much lower
direct transaction costs and the initial investment to trade
becomes a sink cost that does not have a major impact in
individual trades.
We compare our results with a buy and hold (B&H)
position, a constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP), and
Cover’s universal portfolio (CUP) algorithm.
CRP and
CUP are implemented with uniform distributions, and with
10 different portfolios for the case of CUP9.

Due to the high complexity in neural networks, they have a tendency to
overﬁt to the given training data, which yields poor generalization to unseen
data points.
To overcome this problem, several regularization techniques
have been proposed. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this is often equal to in-
troducing an informative prior on the weights, and ﬁnding the optimal set
of weights via Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) [3]. More formally,
given a data set D and a prior distribution of the weights, p(w), the optimal
set of weights is estimated by

• Hyperparameter Tuning: BO excels at optimizing hyperparameters in algorithmic trading strategies, such as
the atr_multiplier and atr_period of the Supertrend indicator. By finding the optimal settings, BO can
potentially enhance the strategy’s performance and profitability.
• Portfolio Allocation: BO can be applied to optimize portfolio allocation across various assets, balancing risk
and return based on historical data and market conditions.
• Risk Management: BO can be used to optimize risk management parameters, such as stop-loss and take-profit
levels, helping to mitigate potential losses.

difference when we used only four different variations of
the parameters. So, we included four different versions of
most of the technical indicators in our training, validation,
and testing set. In total, each instance of the training, val-
idation, and testing set had 112 inputs. We were able to
use this approach because of the boosting’s feature selec-
tion capability (see the appendix for a presentation of the
parameters used).
In our experiments we observed that a small change in
the sample may lead to diferent ADTs changing the invest-
ment recommendation. In order to prevent this problem,
our algorithm generates different ADTs and, in the next
layer, selects the output of the best ADTs.

Layer 2:
Online learning and expert
weighting
Figure 4. Trading system as a process ﬂow. The inputs
of the algorithm are price series that are transformed into
technical indicators and trading rules. The ﬁrst component
trains several ADTs (experts) and each of them generates
an investment signal. The second layer weights the invest-
ment signals of each ADT, and generates a weighted single
investment signal for each stock using an online learning
algorithm. The third layer ﬁlters the weak investment sig-
nals, and restricts not proﬁtable trading strategies.
sis. We calculated these indicators using R and its ﬁnancial
engineering package called Rmetrics.6
We improved the performance of the boosting algorithm
by adding online learning capacity with expert weighting.
Our algorithm is derived from a previous algorithm pro-
posed by Freund, Manssour and Schapire [34] that predicts
with a exponentially weighted average of the training er-
ror of all hypotheses. The “exponential weights” formula
comes from the weighted majority algorithm introduced by
Littlestone and Warmuth [52] and further studied by Cesa-
Bianchi et al. [12]. The “exponential weights” is a different
formula to compute the posterior distribution as it would
be proposed by Bayesian analysis. An interesting feature
of this algorithm is that it abstains to predict on certain in-
stances, so the predictions that it makes are very reliable.
The algorithm that we present in the next subsection is
an extension of this original algorithm applied to ﬁnancial
time series prediction, and therefore is an online learning
model.8 The machine learning layer introduced in the pre-
vious section and the online learning layer of our trading
system have two different functions:
• The machine learning layer generates several “ex-
perts” or ADTs using historical stock price informa-
tion. Each ADT has a set of rules that combines the
technical indicators, and generates an investment sig-
nal for each stock.
• The online learning layer receives the new prices,
combines the signals of the different ADTs gener-
ated by the machine learning layer, and reallocates
the portfolio according to the recommendations of the
“experts”, and the input received from the risk man-
agement module (see section 3.3.1).
In the next section, we describe the algorithm used by the
online learning layer.
Our goal was to predict the trend of beta excess
returns (BXRET)7 using the above investment signals.
yt ∈[−1, +1] is the binary label to be predicted where 1
represents the expectation of a positive beta excess return,
and -1 otherwise.
A major problem with the use of technical indica-
tors is their calibration or the adequate selection of their
best parameters, as with the optimal number of days to
calculate the moving averages used by stochastic indica-
tors or the number of standard deviations used to calcu-
late the Bollinger bands. There are many versions of op-
timizers such as the “brute force” approach where all the
alternatives are tested one-at-a-time, and simulated anneal-
ing or genetic optimizers as suggested by Katz and Mc-
Cormick [44]. In our case, we initially tried one-at-a-time
optimization where each parameter was tested with several
values while keeping the others constant. We found that
this approach was very inefﬁcient because it required too
much computer power and time.
The solution that we implemented was the simulta-
neous recalculation of the technical indicators with several
values of their parameters. Then the boosting algorithm
would select the best combination of parameters and tech-
nical indicators. Our initial parameters were the parame-
ters recommended in the literature. We tested 16 different
variations of the initial parameters and did not ﬁnd a major

7Beta excess return is the excess return of a speciﬁc asset less the av-
erage return of all assets in its beta portfolio for each trading date.
8Borodin and El-Yaniv [11, 28] propose a different approach to use
online learning for trading and portfolio selection. They measure the per-
formance of their trading algorithm in relation to a “statistical adversary”,
and an optimal ofﬂine algorithm.

Backtesting is the process of creating the historical trades given the
historical information available at that time, and then ﬁnding out
what the subsequent performance of those trades is. This process
seems easy given that the trades were made using a computer algo-
rithm in our case, but there are numerous ways in which it can go
wrong. Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical
performance that is better than what we would have obtained in ac-
tual trading. We have already seen how survivorship bias in the data
used for backtesting can result in inﬂated performance. There are,

A key difference between a traditional investment management pro-
cess and a quantitative investment process is the possibility of back-
testing a quantitative investment strategy to see how it would have
performed in the past. Even if you found a strategy described in
complete detail with all the historical performance data available,
you would still need to backtest it yourself. This exercise serves
several purposes. If nothing else, this replication of the research will
ensure that you have understood the strategy completely and have
reproduced it exactly for implementation as a trading system. Just
as in any medical or scientiﬁc research, replicating others’ results
also ensures that the original research did not commit any of the
common errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-
ing due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-
iment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and
improving the strategy.
In this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can
be used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for
backtesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a
backtest should provide, common pitfalls to avoid, and simple re-
ﬁnements and improvements to strategies. A few fully developed
backtesting examples will also be presented to illustrate the prin-
ciples and techniques described.

After you have built your automated trading system, it is a good idea
to test it in a paper trading account, if your brokerage provides one.
Paper trading has a number of beneﬁts; chief among them is that
this is practically the only way to see if your ATS software has bugs
without losing a lot of real money.
Often, the moment you start paper trading you will realize that
there is a glaring look-ahead bias in your strategy—there may just be
no way you could have obtained some crucial piece of data before
you enter an order! If this happens, it is “back to the drawing board.”
You should be able run your ATS, execute paper trades, and then
compare the paper trades and proﬁt and loss (P&L) with the theoret-
ical ones generated by your backtest program using the latest data.
If the difference is not due to transaction costs (including an ex-
pected delay in execution for the paper trades), then your software
likely has bugs. (I mentioned the names of some of the brokerages
that offer paper trading accounts in Chapter 4.)
Another beneﬁt of paper trading is that it gives you better in-
tuitive understanding of your strategy, including the volatility of its
P&L, the typical amount of capital utilized, the number of trades per
day, and the various operational difﬁculties including data issues.
Even though you can theoretically check out most of these features
of your strategy in a backtest, one will usually gain intuition only if
one faces them on a daily, ongoing basis. Backtesting also won’t re-
veal the operational difﬁculties, such as how fast you can download
all the needed data before the market opens each day and how you
can optimize your operational procedures in actual execution.
(Do not underestimate the time required for preparing your or-
ders before the market opens. It took me some 20 minutes to down-
load and parse all my historical data each morning, and it took an-
other 15 minutes or so to transmit all the orders to my account. If
your trading strategy depends on data or news prior to the market
open that cannot be more than 35 minutes old, then you need to
either ﬁgure out a different execution environment or modify your

A
t this point, you should have backtested a good strategy
(maybe something like the pair-trading strategy in Example
3.6), picked a brokerage (e.g., Interactive Brokers), and have
set up a good operating environment (at ﬁrst, nothing more than a
computer, a high-speed Internet connection, and a real-time news-
feed). You are almost ready to execute your trading strategy—after
you have implemented an automated trading system (ATS) to gener-
ate and transmit your orders to your brokerage for execution. This
chapter is about building such an automated trading system and
ways to minimize trading costs and divergence with your expected
performance based on your backtests.

performance of the strategy from its backtest performance. Issues
discussed here include:
r Data: Split/dividend adjustments, noise in daily high/low, and
survivorship bias.
r Performance measurement: Annualized Sharpe ratio and maxi-
mum drawdown.
r Look-ahead bias: Using unobtainable future information for past
trading decisions.
r Data-snooping bias: Using too many parameters to ﬁt historical
data, and avoiding it using large enough sample, out-of-sample
testing, and sensitivity analysis.
r Transaction cost: Impact of transaction costs on performance.
r Strategy reﬁnement: Common ways to make small variations on
the strategy to optimize performance.
After going through this chapter and working through some of
the examples and exercises, you should have gained some hands-on
experience in how to retrieve historical data and backtest a strategy
with either Excel or MATLAB.
When one starts testing a strategy, it may not be possible to
avoid all these pitfalls due to constraints of time and other re-
sources. In this case, it is okay to skip a few precautions to achieve
a quick sense of whether the strategy has potential and is worthy of
closer examination. Sometimes, even the most thorough and careful
backtest cannot reveal problems that would be obvious after a few
months of paper or real trading. One can always revisit each of these
issues after the model has gone live.
Once you have backtested a strategy with reasonable perfor-
mance, you are now ready to take the next step in setting up your
trading business.

COMMON BACKTESTING PITFALLS
TO AVOID
Backtesting is the process of creating the historical trades given the
historical information available at that time, and then ﬁnding out
what the subsequent performance of those trades is. This process
seems easy given that the trades were made using a computer algo-
rithm in our case, but there are numerous ways in which it can go
wrong. Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat­
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com­
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa­
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actually not the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as
historical fundamental data). Furthermore, many of these academic

he ﬁrst six chapters of this book covered most of the ba-
sic knowledge needed to research, develop, and execute your
own quantitative strategy. This chapter explains important
themes in quantitative trading in more detail. These themes form the
bases of statistical arbitrage trading, and most quantitative traders
are conversant in some if not most of these topics. They are also
very helpful in informing our intuition about trading.
I will describe the two basic categories of trading strategies:
mean-reverting versus momentum strategies. Periods of mean-
reverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders
call regimes, and the switch between different regimes is a topic of
discussion here. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathemati-
cal justiﬁcation from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration
of time series, which I will cover next. Then I will describe a the-
ory that many hedge funds use to manage large portfolios and one
that has caused much turmoil in their performances: namely, factor
models. Other categories of strategies that traders frequently dis-
cuss are seasonal trading and high-frequency strategies. All trading
strategies require a way to exit their positions; I will describe the dif-
ferent logical ways to do this. Finally, I ponder the question of how
to best enhance the returns of a strategy: through higher leverage or
trading higher-beta stocks?

some seasonal trades in commodity futures described in Chapter 7).

Technical indicators are calculations which are based on the price and volume of a security. They 
are used both to confirm the trend and the quality of chart patterns, and to help traders determine the 
buy and sell signals.The indicators can be applied separately to form buy and sell signals, as well as 
can be used together, in conjunction with chart patterns and price movement.
Technical analysis indicators can form buy and sell signals through crossovers and divergence. 
Crossovers are reflected when price moves through the moving average or when two different 
moving averages cross each other. Divergence happens when the price trend and the indicator 
trend move in opposite directions indicating that the direction of price trend is weakening.

Forex technical analysis is the study of market action primarily through the use of charts for the 
purpose of forecasting future price trends. Forex traders can develop strategies based on various 
technical analysis tools including market trend, volume, range,support and resistance levels, chart 
patterns and indicators, as well as conduct a Multiple Time Frame Analysis using different time-
frame charts.
Technical analysis strategy is a crucial method of evaluating assets based on the analysis and 
statistics of past market action, such as past prices and past volume. The main goal of technical 
analysts is not the measuring of asset’s underlying value, they attempt to use charts or other tools 
of technical analysis to determine patterns that will help to forecast future market activity. Their firm 
belief is that the future performance of markets can be indicated by the historical performance.

This book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-
tive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about
speciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-
ample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-
stead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy
yourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how
to reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical
performance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain

Example of the use of this methodology
I report the following practical example; the figure shows the trend of a hypothetical stock. The 
value of this stock on a thousand time intervals rises one unit 60% of the time and goes down by one 
unit 40% of the time. In order to simplify the calculations the price movement is unitary. Now let us 
look at two strategies that execute 500 trades, each trade lasts an interval of time. The first strategy 
execute only buys  and in order to choose when to buy, flips a coin, if it win opens a trades if loses 
it waits for the next unit of time and repeats the operation. The second strategy, on the other hand, 
is a strategy that sells only, but does not do it in a random way, it uses information that allows it a 
10% advantage in determining the drops of the value stock.
The first strategy gets a profit of 100 by winning 60% of trades. Now we calculate the probability 
of obtaining a better result in a random way, to do this we use the binomial cumulative distribution 
function with the following parameters:
p = 60% (probability of win)

By using the binomial distribution formula, given a value of L, we can obtain the probability 
of achieving better results with the random strategy described above. The results for the L values 
ranging from 10 to 200 are shown in Figure 1. Looking at the figure, we see how the probability 
tends asymptotically toward 50%. Therefore, we have a 50% chance of getting better or worse 
results. Basically, the strategy described in the paradox tends asymptotically toward a random 
strategy. Consequently, the doubling-down strategy turns out to be a strategy that does not 
implement useful information for improving our likelihood of victory. Thus, using the cognitive 
aspect as a method of evaluation has proven the irrationality of the strategy.
We use very similar approaches, where the strategy being evaluated is compared with an 
equivalent random strategy, in the financial field to analyse the results generated by a trading

A
ll trading strategies suffer occasional losses, technically
known as drawdowns. The drawdowns may last a few min-
utes or a few years. To proﬁt from a quantitative trading busi-
ness, it is essential to manage your risks in a way that limits your
drawdowns to a tolerable level and yet be positioned to use opti-
mal leverage of your equity to achieve maximum possible growth of
your wealth. Furthermore, if you have more than one strategy, you
will also need to ﬁnd a way to optimally allocate capital among them
so as to maximize overall risk-adjusted return.
The optimal allocation of capital and the optimal leverage to use
so as to strike the right balance between risk management and max-
imum growth is the focus of this chapter, and the central tool we
use is called the Kelly formula.

One of the most powerful means of winning a trade is the portfolio of Forex trading strat­
egies applied by traders in different situations. Following a single system all the time is 
not enough for a successful trade. Each trader should know how to face up to all market 
conditions, which, however, is not so easy, and requires a deep study and understanding of 
economics.
In order to help you meet your educational needs and create your own portfolio of trading 
strategies, IFC Markets provides you both with reliable resources on trading and with com­
plete information of all the popular and simple forex trading strategies applied by successful 
traders.
The trading strategies we represent are suitable for all traders who are novice in trade or 
want to improve their skills. All the strategies classified and explained below are for educa­
tional purposes and can be applied by each trader in a different way.

is of ultimate importance.)
One approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-
tribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,
with a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should
be net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)
This is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite
inaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with
far higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-

Using these data, we get a probability to get better results randomly of the 48.3%. 
   Now let us consider the second strategy, this strategy has a total result of zero in practice it 
performs 250 winning trades and 250 losing trades (the 10% advantage allows it to increase the 
probability of victory from 40% to 50%). Also in this case, we calculate the probability of obtaining 
better results randomly, to do this we use the formula of the binomial cumulative distribution

fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-

discussed, is not used to make a profit; it rather aims to reduce the risk and uncertainty.
