xiv PREFACE
proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.



of his programmer, who happened to have picked it up from the
trader’s desk. He was afraid the programmer might learn his “se-
crets.”) That may be because people are less wary of letting you
know their secrets when they think you won’t be obliterating their
proﬁts by allocating $100 million to that strategy.
No, the difﬁculty is not the lack of ideas. The difﬁculty is to de-
velop a taste for which strategy is suitable for your personal circum-
stances and goals, and which ones look viable even before you de-
vote the time to diligently backtest them. This taste for prospective
strategies is what I will try to convey in this chapter.
HOW TO IDENTIFY A STRATEGY THAT
SUITS YOU
Whether a strategy is viable often does not have anything to do with
the strategy itself—it has to do with you. Here are some considera-
tions.
Your Working Hours
Do you trade only part time? If so, you would probably want to con-
sider only strategies that hold overnight and not the intraday strate-



reach the optimal parameter settings, especially for problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces.
• Global Optimization: BO avoids getting stuck in local optima by balancing exploration and exploitation during
the search process.
• Data-Driven Approach: BO leverages past evaluations to improve its understanding of the objective function
and guide the search towards better solutions.
2.2.3 Importance in Algorithmic Trading:
• Hyperparameter Tuning: BO excels at optimizing hyperparameters in algorithmic trading strategies, such as
the atr_multiplier and atr_period of the Supertrend indicator. By finding the optimal settings, BO can
potentially enhance the strategy’s performance and profitability.
• Portfolio Allocation: BO can be applied to optimize portfolio allocation across various assets, balancing risk
and return based on historical data and market conditions.
• Risk Management: BO can be used to optimize risk management parameters, such as stop-loss and take-profit



from the data itself, govern how a trading strategy operates. In the context of the Supertrend indicator, the atr multiplier
and atr period are prime examples of hyperparameters. Identifying their optimal settings is paramount for maximizing a
strategy’s effectiveness [Osório et al., 2020].
Traditional optimization methods, such as grid search or random search, can be employed to explore the parameter
space. However, these methods can become computationally expensive, especially as the number of hyperparameters
increases.[Greenblatt et al., 2016]
Bayesian Optimization (BO) emerges as a powerful alternative. This data-driven approach efficiently navigates large
parameter spaces by leveraging past evaluations to prioritize promising areas for exploration. This iterative process
allows BO to converge on the optimal parameter combination significantly faster than traditional methods .[Greenblatt
et al., 2016]

ABSTRACT
This thesis investigates the potential of Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the atr multiplier and
atr period -the parameters of the Supertrend indicator for maximizing trading profits across diverse
stock datasets. By employing BO, the thesis aims to automate the identification of optimal parameter
settings, leading to a more data-driven and potentially more profitable trading strategy compared to
relying on manually chosen parameters. The effectiveness of the BO-optimized Supertrend strategy
will be evaluated through backtesting on a variety of stock datasets.

1 Introduction



unveil the potential for enhanced profitability within the algorithmic trading landscape. Further explored whether BO
can unlock the hidden potential within the Supertrend framework, potentially leading to strategies that consistently
outperform the baseline. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the pursuit of maximum profits inherently involves
risk management considerations. Also addressesing these trade-offs and emphasizing the importance of backtesting
and risk mitigation strategies before deploying any optimized strategy in a real-world trading environment.([Patil and
Gala, 2022b]). This formal introduction sets the stage for our exploration. In the subsequent sections, the thesis delves
deeper into the relevant scholarly literature surrounding the Supertrend indicator and Bayesian optimization, establishes
the problem statement and data considerations, and outlines the methodologies employed to optimize and evaluate the
Supertrend-based strategies.
