*It works for two scenarios:*

1. Breakout with no retracement.
2. Breakout with retracement.

**Basic Indicators Used**

• Support and Resistance Levels – Identify consolidation ""boxes"" or resistance areas.
• Volume – Increased volume confirms a strong breakout.
• 20-Period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) – Helps identify trend direction and support.
• RSI (Relative Strength Index) – 14-period RSI to confirm momentum (above 50 but below 70 for strength).



**Scenario 1: Breakout with No Retracement**

• Identify the breakout with a strong bullish candle and increased volume.

** Entry: **
-Enter a small position immediately after the breakout (on candle close).
-If price consolidates above the breakout level, add to your position after confirmation.

**Scenario 2: Breakout with Retracement**

• Identify a resistance level or consolidation ""box.""
• Wait for a breakout above resistance with high volume.
• Wait for a retracement back to the breakout level (resistance turns to support).

** Entry:** 
-Enter a long position once the breakout level holds as support. 
-Look for Bullish candlestick confirmation (e.g., bullish engulfing or hammer).
-RSI stays above 50.



**Stop-Loss Placement:**

***Initial Stop-Loss:*** Place stop-loss just below the breakout level (previous resistance turned support).
***Trailing Stop-Loss:*** As price rises, adjust stop-loss to the next higher low or support level to lock in profits.",1

**Indicators**
•**Resistance Level** - A fixed resistance level is set at 2670.00. Price action around this level will determine entry signals.

•**Volume** - The strategy checks for an increase in volume, which is defined as the current volume being greater than 125% of the 10-period simple moving average (SMA) of volume. 

•**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: - The RSI is calculated over a 14-period timeframe

***Buy Entry (Breakout):***

•If the closing price (close) is greater than the resistance level (2670.00), and the volume is increasing (current volume > 1.25 * 10-period SMA of volume).
•When this condition is met, it indicates a potential breakout, and you should enter a long position.

***Sell Entry (Rejection):***

• If the closing price is below the resistance level and the RSI value is greater than 70. This indicates that the price may be rejecting the resistance.
• When this condition is met, it implies a potential price reversal, and you should enter a short position.",1
