proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.
The book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that
traders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-
ness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-
ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing
the money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this
strategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of
important advanced concepts with which most professional quan-
titative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with
reﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how
they can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that
contains a tutorial on using MATLAB.
You’ll see two different types of boxed material in this book:



Forex Strategies Based on Trading Style
   Portfolio trading, which can also be called basket trading, is based on the combination of different 
assets belonging to different financial markets (Forex, stock, futures, etc.).
   The concept behind portfolio trading is diversification, one of the most popular means of risk re -
duction. By a smart asset allocation traders protect themselves from market volatility, reduce the risk 
extent and keep the profit balance.
   It’s very important to create a diversified portfolio to reach your trading goal. Otherwise, this kind 
of strategy will be aimless.
   Currently IFC Markets offers a new method, called GeWorko Method, which makes it even much 
easier for you to perform portfolio trading. The method provides numerous opportunities for traders 
to take the highest profit from trade. By Geworko Method you can create portfolios starting from 
only two assets up to hundreds of different financial instruments, open both long and short positions 
within a portfolio, view the assets’ price history stretching up to 40 years, create your own PCIs, use 
a wide variety of market analysis tools, apply different trading strategies and constantly optimize and 
rebalance your portfolio. In other words, GeWorko Method seems the integrity of all trading opportu-
nities and strategies, through which you can organize your trade in the way you desire, develop the 
strategy you want and what is the most important, stay safe from sudden and tragic losses.d tragic 
losses.
Portfolio / Basket Trading Strategy
You should compile your portfolio with such securities (currencies, stocks, commodities, indi -
ces) which are not strictly correlated, meaning that their returns do not move up and down in a 
perfect unison. By mixing up different assets in your portfolio which are in negative correlation, 
with one security’s price going up and the other’s going down you can keep the portfolio’s bal-

of his programmer, who happened to have picked it up from the
trader’s desk. He was afraid the programmer might learn his “se-
crets.”) That may be because people are less wary of letting you
know their secrets when they think you won’t be obliterating their
proﬁts by allocating $100 million to that strategy.
No, the difﬁculty is not the lack of ideas. The difﬁculty is to de-
velop a taste for which strategy is suitable for your personal circum-
stances and goals, and which ones look viable even before you de-
vote the time to diligently backtest them. This taste for prospective
strategies is what I will try to convey in this chapter.
HOW TO IDENTIFY A STRATEGY THAT
SUITS YOU
Whether a strategy is viable often does not have anything to do with
the strategy itself—it has to do with you. Here are some considera-
tions.
Your Working Hours
Do you trade only part time? If so, you would probably want to con-
sider only strategies that hold overnight and not the intraday strate-



reach the optimal parameter settings, especially for problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces.
• Global Optimization: BO avoids getting stuck in local optima by balancing exploration and exploitation during
the search process.
• Data-Driven Approach: BO leverages past evaluations to improve its understanding of the objective function
and guide the search towards better solutions.
2.2.3 Importance in Algorithmic Trading:
• Hyperparameter Tuning: BO excels at optimizing hyperparameters in algorithmic trading strategies, such as
the atr_multiplier and atr_period of the Supertrend indicator. By finding the optimal settings, BO can
potentially enhance the strategy’s performance and profitability.
• Portfolio Allocation: BO can be applied to optimize portfolio allocation across various assets, balancing risk
and return based on historical data and market conditions.
• Risk Management: BO can be used to optimize risk management parameters, such as stop-loss and take-profit



from the data itself, govern how a trading strategy operates. In the context of the Supertrend indicator, the atr multiplier
and atr period are prime examples of hyperparameters. Identifying their optimal settings is paramount for maximizing a
strategy’s effectiveness [Osório et al., 2020].
Traditional optimization methods, such as grid search or random search, can be employed to explore the parameter
space. However, these methods can become computationally expensive, especially as the number of hyperparameters
increases.[Greenblatt et al., 2016]
Bayesian Optimization (BO) emerges as a powerful alternative. This data-driven approach efficiently navigates large
parameter spaces by leveraging past evaluations to prioritize promising areas for exploration. This iterative process
allows BO to converge on the optimal parameter combination significantly faster than traditional methods .[Greenblatt
et al., 2016]

to use for your strategy.
MINIMIZING TRANSACTION COSTS
We saw in Chapter 3 how transaction costs can impact a strategy’s
actual return. Besides changing your brokerage or proprietary trad-
ing ﬁrm to one that charges a lower commission, there are a few
things you can do in your execution method to minimize the trans-
action costs.
To cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-



vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.

traders’ forums may have worked only for a little while, or they
work for only a certain class of stocks, or they work only if you
don’t factor in transaction costs. However, the trick is that you
can often modify the basic strategy and make it proﬁtable. (Many
